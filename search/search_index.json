            "text": "CentOS Version\n\n\nThis guide only caters for CentOS 7. If you \nreally\n want to run CentOS 6, you would either need to adapt this installation guide with the appropriate init scripts, or use the SeAT tool for installation.\n\n\n\n\nCentos 7\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis guide attempts to explain how to manually install SeAT onto a \nCentOS\n Server. A small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, although it is not entirely mandatory.\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe are going to assume you have root access to a fresh CentOS Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \nyum\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\n\n\nEve Application and ESI\nSeAT 3.0 consumes CCP's \nESI\n service in order to retrieve EVE Online related information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to register a third party EVE application on the developers portal. This is an absolute must for SeAT to be of any use. The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nOperating System\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics :\n\n\n\n\nyum update\n to update any installed packages.\n\n\nreboot\n in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version.\n\n\n\n\nRepositories\n\u00b6\n\n\nDue to the nature of CentOS's packaging and the limitations in getting 'bleeding edge' software with it, we need to add some extra software repositories in order to get SeAT running. The repositories used are the \nFedora EPEL\n repository, \nRemi\n repository as well as the MariaDB repository.\n\n\nInstall and configure the required repositories with the following commands:\n\n\nEPEL\n\u00b6\n\n\n# Download and install EPEL\n\n\nEPEL\n=\nepel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm \n&&\n curl -O https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/\n$EPEL\n \n&&\n yum localinstall -y \n$EPEL\n \n&&\n rm -f \n$EPEL\n\n\n\n# Import signing key\n\nrpm --import \n\"http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemi\n\u00b6\n\n\n# Download and install Epel\n\n\nREMI\n=\nremi-release-7.rpm \n&&\n curl -O http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/\n$REMI\n \n&&\n yum localinstall -y \n$REMI\n \n&&\n rm -f \n$REMI\n\n\n\n# Import signing key\n\nrpm --import http://rpms.remirepo.net/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi\n\n\n\n\n\nMariaDB\n\u00b6\n\n\n# Configure the MariaDB repository\n\ncurl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup \n|\n bash\n\n\n\n\n\nRepository Configurations\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnly a small amount of configuration is needed after installing these repositories. Basically, we just want to enable PHP 7.1 for use with SeAT. So, do that with:\n\n\nyum install yum-utils -y \n&&\n yum-config-manager --enable remi,remi-php71\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.\n\n\nThis document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.\n\n\nLets install the database server:\n\n\nyum install mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time our server boots up:\n\n\nsystemctl \nenable\n mariadb.service \n&&\n systemctl start mariadb.service\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. An example run is shown below:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nEnter current password \nfor\n root \n(\nenter \nfor\n none\n)\n:  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nSet root password? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove \ntest\n database and access to it? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.\n\n\nNext, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the \nmysql\n command line client and enter a few commands as the \nroot\n user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the \nmysql\n client as root by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\n\n\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\nroot@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with \n;\n or \n\\g\n.\nYour MariaDB connection id is \n16\n\nCopyright \n(\nc\n)\n \n2000\n, \n2018\n, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.\n\nType \n'help;'\n or \n'\\h'\n \nfor\n help. Type \n'\\c'\n to clear the current input statement.\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n>\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new database for SeAT to use with:\n\n\ncreate database seat\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n> create database seat\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n1\n row affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we  need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own unique and strong password.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n0\n rows affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as \nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\n\n\nFinally, we will flush the database server privileges:\n\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with \nexit\n;\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Currently only PHP 7.1 is supported (and is already enabled via the Remi repository earlier in this guide) due to issues with Laravel (the framework SeAT is built on) and PHP 7.2. This should change in the very near future.\n\n\nInstall the required PHP packages now with:\n\n\nyum install -y php php-cli php-mysqlnd php-posix php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring php-intl php-dom php-gd unzip\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\nyum install -y redis\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, start it and configure it to auto start next time the server boots up:\n\n\nsystemctl \nenable\n redis.service \n&&\n systemctl start redis.service\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nExcellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called \ncomposer\n as well as the \ngit\n client. The combination of \ncomposer\n and \ngit\n will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally.\n\n\nGit\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstall \ngit\n with:\n\n\nyum -y install git\n\n\n\n\n\nComposer\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, install \ncomposer\n with:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer \n|\n php -- --install-dir\n=\n/usr/local/bin --filename\n=\ncomposer \n&&\n \nhash\n -r\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within \n/var/www/seat\n. As part of the installation, the \nseat\n directory will be created for us, but we will need to create \n/var/www\n for now as we have not yet configured the web server.\n\n\nCreate the \nwww\n directory with:\n\n\nmkdir -p /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, \ncd\n to the new \n/var/www\n directory with:\n\n\ncd\n /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith all of the prerequisites installed as well as our \nwww\n directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with:\n\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev --stability\n=\nbeta\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the download is done, you should have seen output such as:\n\n\nWriting lock file\nGenerating optimized autoload files\n> Illuminate\n\\F\noundation\n\\C\nomposerScripts::postAutoloadDump\n> @php artisan package:discover\nDiscovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/api\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/console\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/eveapi\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/notifications\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/services\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/web\nPackage manifest generated successfully.\n> @php artisan key:generate\nApplication key \n[\nbase64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k\n=]\n \nset\n successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have noticed a warning about \ncomposer\n running as \nroot\n. For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with:\n\n\nchown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/seat\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs.\n\n\nSELinux\n\u00b6\n\n\nMany people hate SELinux, primarily due to a misunderstanding of what it does and how it works. SeAT will run perfectly fine with SELinux enabled, and I actually encourage you to leave it enabled. There is however one small settings change required to make everything work as expected.\n\n\nFirst, we have to allow web servers to make network connections. This is so that we may connect to ESI, as well as the MariaDB database and Redis. We also have to allow nginx to write to disk. So, configure this with:\n\n\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect \n1\n\nsetsebool -P httpd_unified \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to ensure that the files and folders in \n/var/www/seat\n is correctly labelled in order to prevent SELinux from blocking perfectly normal behaviour. Do this with:\n\n\nrestorecon -Rv /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is really it. Pretty painless eh?\n\n\nSeAT Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications \n.env\n file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n.env setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n with something like \nvi\n or \nnano\n and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as \nDB_HOST\n accordingly.\n\n\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\n\n\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\n\n\nDB_PORT=3306\n\n\nDB_DATABASE=seat\n\n\nDB_USERNAME=seat\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n \n# <-- this is the value you probably need to edit.\n\n\nDB_DEBUG=false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Migrations and Seeds\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule.\n\n\nPublish the assets and database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u nginx bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u nginx bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed the SeAT schedule with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u nginx bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVE Sde Update\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE \nStatic Data Exports\n. MySQL conversions of this data is available at \nhttps://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/\n and used in SeAT.\n\n\nTo update to the \nlatest SDE\n within SeAT, run:\n\n\nsudo -H -u nginx bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using \nLaravel Horizon\n and is monitored using \nsupervisord\n.\n\n\nTo configure the Horizon process monitor, first install \nsupervisor\n:\n\n\nyum install -y supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in \n/etc/supervisord.d/seat.ini\n. Create this file with its recommended configuration with:\n\n\ncat > /etc/supervisord.d/seat.ini \n<< EOL\n\n\n[program:seat]\n\n\ncommand=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon\n\n\nprocess_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d\n\n\nstdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log\n\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB\n\n\nstdout_logfile_backups=10\n\n\nnumprocs=1\n\n\ndirectory=/var/www/seat\n\n\nstopwaitsecs=600\n\n\nuser=nginx\n\n\nEOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, start \nsupervisord\n and make sure it will auto start next time the server boots up with: \n\n\nsystemctl \nenable\n supervisord \n&&\n systemctl restart supervisord\n\n\n\n\n\nCrontab\n\u00b6\n\n\nA crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The \nactual\n schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface.\n\n\nTo configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands:\n\n\necho\n \n'* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1'\n > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, add this crontab for the \nnginx\n user with:\n\n\ncrontab -u nginx /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with \ncrontab -u nginx -l\n.\n\n\nWeb Server\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAlmost there!\nYou almost made it to the end! Just one more step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use \nnginx\n and will be covered in this document. You don't \nhave\n to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nNginx Install\n\u00b6\n\n\nTogether with an \nnginx\n installation we also need to install \nphp-fpm\n to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install \nnginx\n and \nphp-fpm\n with:\n\n\nyum install -y nginx php-fpm\n\n\n\n\n\nNginx Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the webserver installed, we need to configure \nnginx\n to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell \nnginx\n where to find \nphp-fpm\n as well as where the assets are for SeAT.\n\n\nThe configuration file will live at \n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n. It can be created with the following command:\n\n\ncat > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf \n<< EOL\n\n\n# For more information on configuration, see:\n\n\n#   * Official English Documentation: http://nginx.org/en/docs/\n\n\n#   * Official Russian Documentation: http://nginx.org/ru/docs/\n\n\n\nuser nginx;\n\n\nworker_processes auto;\n\n\nerror_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;\n\n\npid /run/nginx.pid;\n\n\n\n# Load dynamic modules.

Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again.\n\n\nTo login as an administrator, simply run the following command :\n\n\nsudo -H -u nginx bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow:\n\n\n[root@localhost nginx]# sudo -H -u nginx bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\nSeAT Admin Login URL Generator\nUser 'admin' does not exist.

This is most likely incorrect and you can simply replace \nlocalhost\n with your IP address or domain name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESI Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the guide, it is necessary for you to configure ESI.

It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.  Lets install the database server:  yum install mariadb-server  With the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time our server boots up:  systemctl  enable  mariadb.service  &&  systemctl start mariadb.service  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password.   Note  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. An example run is shown below:  [ ... ] \n\nEnter current password  for  root  ( enter  for  none ) :  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] \n\nSet root password?  [ Y/n ]  y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove anonymous users?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nDisallow root login remotely?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove  test  database and access to it?  [ Y/n ]  y [ ... ] \n\nReload privilege tables now?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.  Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the  mysql  command line client and enter a few commands as the  root  user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.  Fire up the  mysql  client as root by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation .

A small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, although it is not entirely mandatory.\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe are going to assume you have root access to a fresh Ubuntu Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \naptitude\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\n\n\nEve Application and ESI\nSeAT 3.0 consumes CCP's \nESI\n service in order to retrieve EVE Online related information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to register a third party EVE application on the developers portal. This is an absolute must for SeAT to be of any use. The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nOperating System\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics :\n\n\n\n\napt-get update\n to refresh the repositories cache.\n\n\napt-get full-upgrade\n to update any installed packages.\n\n\nreboot\n in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version.\n\n\napt-get autoremove\n (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.\n\n\nThis document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.\n\n\nWe need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Before we can configure the repository though, we need to install come tools. Do that with:\n\n\napt-get install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets add the MariaDB repository with:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup \n|\n bash\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the repository now setup, lets install the database server:\n\n\n\n\nWarning\nDuring the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the \nroot\n MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\napt-get install mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password (if you have not been prompted for it yet).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nEnter current password \nfor\n root \n(\nenter \nfor\n none\n)\n:  IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nSet root password? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove \ntest\n database and access to it? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.\n\n\nNext, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the \nmysql\n command line client and enter a few commands as the \nroot\n user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the \nmysql\n client as root by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\n\n\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\nroot@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MariaDB monitor.

You can exit the prompt with \nexit\n;\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Currently only PHP 7.1 is supported due to issues with Laravel (the framework SeAT is built on) and PHP 7.2. This should change in the very near future. Debian based systems can make use of \nSury DPA\n which is a very popular repository used for specific PHP versions.\n\n\nDepending on the version of Debian you are using, a release specific repository URL should be used for the repository. Select the tab applicable to your Debian version and run the commands within.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch 9\n\n\nJessie 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho \"deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\necho \"deb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho \"deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\necho \"deb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will have to download the repository GPG signing key and add it into our keychain\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com AC0E47584A7A714D\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the new repository configured, update the package lists with:\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, install the required PHP packages with:\n\n\napt-get install curl zip php7.1-cli php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-intl php7.1-curl php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring php7.1-bz2 php7.1-dom php7.1-zip\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\napt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nExcellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called \ncomposer\n as well as the \ngit\n client. The combination of \ncomposer\n and \ngit\n will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally.\n\n\nGit\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstall \ngit\n with:\n\n\napt-get install git\n\n\n\n\n\nComposer\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, install \ncomposer\n with:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer \n|\n php -- --install-dir\n=\n/usr/local/bin --filename\n=\ncomposer \n&&\n \nhash\n -r\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within \n/var/www/seat\n. As part of the installation, the \nseat\n directory will be created for us, but we will need to create \n/var/www\n for now as we have not yet configured the web server.\n\n\nCreate the \nwww\n directory with:\n\n\nmkdir -p /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, \ncd\n to the new \n/var/www\n directory with:\n\n\ncd\n /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith all of the prerequisites installed as well as our \nwww\n directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with:\n\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev --stability\n=\nbeta\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the download is done, you should have seen output such as:\n\n\nWriting lock file\nGenerating optimized autoload files\n> Illuminate\n\\F\noundation\n\\C\nomposerScripts::postAutoloadDump\n> @php artisan package:discover\nDiscovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/api\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/console\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/eveapi\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/notifications\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/services\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/web\nPackage manifest generated successfully.\n> @php artisan key:generate\nApplication key \n[\nbase64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k\n=]\n \nset\n successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have noticed a warning about \ncomposer\n running as \nroot\n. For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with:\n\n\nchown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/seat\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs.\n\n\nAdditionally, when commands are run to interact with SeAT, in order to ensure that the permissions stay intact, \nsudo\n will be needed to run commands as the \nwww-data\n user. Lets install \nsudo\n now:\n\n\napt-get install sudo\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications \n.env\n file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n.env setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n with something like \nvi\n or \nnano\n and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as \nDB_HOST\n accordingly.\n\n\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\n\n\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\n\n\nDB_PORT=3306\n\n\nDB_DATABASE=seat\n\n\nDB_USERNAME=seat\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n \n# <-- this is the value you probably need to edit.\n\n\nDB_DEBUG=false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Migrations and Seeds\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule.\n\n\nPublish the assets and database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed the SeAT schedule with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVE Sde Update\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE \nStatic Data Exports\n. MySQL conversions of this data is available at \nhttps://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/\n and used in SeAT.\n\n\nTo update to the \nlatest SDE\n within SeAT, run:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using \nLaravel Horizon\n and is monitored using \nsupervisord\n.\n\n\nTo configure the Horizon process monitor, first install \nsupervisor\n:\n\n\napt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf\n. Create this file with its recommended configuration with:\n\n\ncat > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf \n<< EOL\n\n\n[program:seat]\n\n\ncommand=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon\n\n\nprocess_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d\n\n\nstdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log\n\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB\n\n\nstdout_logfile_backups=10\n\n\nnumprocs=1\n\n\ndirectory=/var/www/seat\n\n\nstopwaitsecs=600\n\n\nuser=www-data\n\n\nEOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload supervisor to apply the new configuration with the following command:\n\n\nsystemctl restart supervisor.service\n\n\n\n\n\nCrontab\n\u00b6\n\n\nA crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The \nactual\n schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface.\n\n\nTo configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands:\n\n\necho\n \n'* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1'\n > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, add this crontab for the \nwww-data\n user with:\n\n\ncrontab -u www-data /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with \ncrontab -u www-data -l\n.\n\n\nWeb Server\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAlmost there!\nYou almost made it to the end! Just one more step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use \nnginx\n and will be covered in this document. You don't \nhave\n to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nNginx Install\n\u00b6\n\n\nTogether with an \nnginx\n installation we also need to install \nphp-fpm\n to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install \nnginx\n and \nphp-fpm\n with:\n\n\napt-get install nginx php7.1-fpm\n\n\n\n\n\nNginx Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the webserver installed, we need to configure \nnginx\n to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell \nnginx\n where to find \nphp-fpm\n as well as where the assets are for SeAT.\n\n\nThe configuration file will live at \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n. It can be created with the following command:\n\n\ncat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat \n<< EOL\n\n\nserver {\n\n\n\n    listen 80;\n\n\n    listen [::]:80;\n\n\n\n    # If you are hosting this instance on a domain, set that\n\n\n    # name here.\n\n\n    #server_name  seat.yourdomain.com;\n\n\n\n    # SeAT public directory. This is the only directory that\n\n\n    # should be exposed by the webserver. If one has to expose\n\n\n    # the parent directory then things like the .env file will\n\n\n    # be available for anyone to download.\n\n\n    root /var/www/seat/public;\n\n\n\n    index index.php;\n\n\n\n    location / {\n\n\n       try_files \\$uri \\$uri/ /index.php?\\$query_string;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # PHP-FPM configuration.\n\n\n    location ~ \\.php\\$ {\n\n\n       try_files \\$uri /index.php =404;\n\n\n       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;\n\n\n       fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \\$document_root\\$fastcgi_script_name;\n\n\n       include fastcgi_params;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # Even though .htaccess rules mean nothing in the nginx\n\n\n    # world, prevent those from being downloaded anyways.\n\n\n    location ~ /\\.ht {\n\n\n       deny all;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # In case someone messes up, prevent .env files from\n\n\n    # being downloaded as well.\n\n\n    location ~ /\\.env {\n\n\n       deny all;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\nEOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration file as is at \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n itself won't be loaded by \nnginx\n yet. Storing configuration files in a \n*sites-available*\n directory is simply a convention used to allow administrators to quickly add & remove sites if needed. To \napply\n the changes made by the new configuration file it needs to be symlinked to a \n*sites-enabled*\n directory.\n\n\nLet's symlink to the new configuration and drop the default one as a hardening exercise at the same time:\n\n\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat\nrm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload \nnginx\n and \nphp-fpm\n for the new changes to take affect:\n\n\nsystemctl restart nginx.service\nsystemctl restart php7.1-fpm.service\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin Login\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT 3.0, an admin user is a special user and can no longer link characters or corporations to it. Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again.\n\n\nTo login as an administrator, simply run the following command :\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow:\n\n\nroot@ubuntu:/var/www/seat# sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\nSeAT Admin Login URL Generator\nUser 'admin' does not exist. It will be created.\nSearching for the 'Superuser' role\nCreating the Superuser role\nChecking if the Superuser role has the superuser permission\nAdding the superuser permission to the role\nChecking if 'admin' is a super user\nAdding 'admin' to the Superuser role\nGenerating authentication token\n\nYour authentication URL is valid for 60 seconds.\nhttp://localhost/auth/login/admin/9G3sb8hjMvrbIJrIf10KKtIj1c8e9mL5\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy it and paste it inside your browser and you will be authenticated as the admin user.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\nIf you have not configured the \nAPP_URL\n setting in the \n.env\n file, then the admin url will be generated for \nlocalhost\n. This is most likely incorrect and you can simply replace \nlocalhost\n with your IP address or domain name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESI Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the guide, it is necessary for you to configure ESI. FOr instructions now how to do this, please refer to the \nESI Setup Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nYou made it! Use a browser and browse to the IP address / hostname of your server to access SeAT!",

It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.  We need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Before we can configure the repository though, we need to install come tools. Do that with:  apt-get install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https  Next, lets add the MariaDB repository with:  curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup  |  bash  With the repository now setup, lets install the database server:   Warning During the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the  root  MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step.    apt-get install mariadb-server  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password (if you have not been prompted for it yet).   Note  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:  [ ... ] \n\nEnter current password  for  root  ( enter  for  none ) :  IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS\nOK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] \n\nSet root password?

[ Y/n ]  y [ ... ] \n\nReload privilege tables now?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.  Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the  mysql  command line client and enter a few commands as the  root  user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.  Fire up the  mysql  client as root by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)  If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MariaDB monitor.

Finally, we will flush the database server privileges:  FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;   That concludes the database server setup.

For information about the hardware requirements for SeAT, please see \nthis\n page. The only major difference between docker and other installation options is that the containers themselves may take up a few hundred MB's of extra space. In most cases this should be a non-issue.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWhen considering a VPS provider, make sure you choose one that does not make use of OpenVZ or similar operating-system level virtualization technologies. These virtualization technologies limit you in terms of kernel access as they purely containerize an existing Linux installation.\n\n\nFor a successful docker installation, choose a provider that uses para-virtualized technologies such as KVM, VMWare or XEN allowing you full control to the instance (and therefor the kernel itself). Examples of such providers are \nDigital Ocean\n, \nLinode\n and \nVultr\n.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Container Setup Overview\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe setup for SeAT's docker installation is built on top of \ndocker-compose\n. With docker-compose, we can use a single \ndocker-compose.yml\n file to define the entire stack complete with dependencies required to run SeAT. A pre-built and recommended compose file (which is also used by the bootstrapping script) is hosted in the scripts repository \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe previously mentioned compose file is really simple. A high level overview of its contents is:\n\n\n\n\nA single docker network called \nseat-network\n is defined. All containers are connected to this network and is used as the primary means for inter-container communications.\n\n\nThree volumes are configured to store data. Those are:\n\n\nseat-code\n: This volume is seeded by the \nseat-app\n container and contains the actual SeAT source code. Any container that needs access to the SeAT sources (such as the app and worker containers) would mount this container to their respective, internal \n/var/www/seat\n directory.\n\n\nredis-data\n: This volume is used purely to let redis periodically backup the cache.\n\n\nmariadb-data\n: This is the \nmost important\n volume as it contains all of the database data. This is the one volume that you should configure a backup solution for!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix services (or containers) are used within the SeAT docker stack. Two of the services are pulled directly from \nDockerhub\n.\n    Four others are custom build and also hosted on DockerHub. Those containers are exposed in the table bellow :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Name\n\n\nImage Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmariadb:10.3\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nredis:3\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/redis/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-nginx\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-nginx/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-app\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-app/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-worker\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-worker/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-cron\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-cron/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment is configured using a top level \n.env\n file (not to be confused with the SeAT specific \n.env\n file (which should be transparent to a docker user anyways.))\n\n\nOnly two ports are exposed by default. Those are \ntcp/8080\n and \ntcp/8443\n. These can be connected to in order to access the SeAT web interface.\n\n\nAll containers are configured to restart on failure, so if your server reboots or a container dies for whatever reason it should automatically start up again.\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Docker Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nDepending on wether you already have \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n already installed, you may choose how to start the installation. If you already have the required tooling installed and running their latest versions, all you need to do is download the latest \ndocker-compose.yml\n and \n.env\n files to get started.\n\n\nAutomated Setup Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have the required software installed yet, consider running the \nbootstrap script\n that will check for \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n, install it and start the SeAT stack up for you. The script can be run with:\n\n\nbash <\n(\ncurl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-docker\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the script is finished, you can skip to the \nmonitoring the stack\n section of this guide.\n\n\nIf you don't want to run this script, follow along in the next section of this guide.\n\n\nDocker Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have \ndocker\n, install it now with the following command as \nroot\n:\n\n\n# Installs docker\n\nsh <\n(\ncurl -fsSL get.docker.com\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker-compose Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have \ndocker-compose\n, install it now with the following command as \nroot\n:\n\n\n# Downloads docker-compose\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose-\n$(\nuname -s\n)\n-\n$(\nuname -m\n)\n -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\n# Makes docker-compose executable\n\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker compose working directory\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n ready, create yourself a directory in \n/opt\n with \nmkdir -p /opt/seat-docker\n and \ncd\n to it. Remember this directory as you will need to come back to it often.\n\n\nSeAT Docker-compose.yml and .env File\n\u00b6\n\n\nThen, download the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file with:\n\n\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/scripts/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, download the docker \n.env\n file with:\n\n\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/scripts/master/docker-compose/.env -o .env \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe location of the \ndocker-compose.yml\n and \n.env\n files are important. You need to \ncd\n back to the directory where these are stored in order to be able to execute commands for this stack at a later stage.\n\n\n\n\nWith the configuration files ready, start up the stack with:\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\n\nYep. Thats all you need to do :)\n\n\nMonitoring the Stack\n\u00b6\n\n\nKnowing what is going on inside of your containers is crucial to understanding how everything is running as well as useful when debugging any problems that may occur. While the containers are starting up or have been running for a while, you can always \ncd\n to the directory where your \ndocker-compose.yml\n file lives and run the \nlogs\n command to see the output of all of the containers in the stack. For example:\n\n\ncd\n /opt/seat-docker\ndocker-compose logs --tail \n10\n -f\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commands will \ncd\n to the directory containing the stacks \ndocker-compose.yml\n file and run the \nlogs\n command, showing the last \n10\n log entries and then printing new ones as they arrive.\n\n\nConfiguration Changes\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll of the relevant configuration lives inside the \n.env\n file, next to your \ndocker-compose.yml\n file. Modify its values by opening it in a text editor, making the appropriate changes and saving it again. Once that is done, run \ndocker-compose up -d\n again to restart the container environment.\n\n\nIf you followed along until now with the docker installation, the next step would be to login as an administrator and to configure SSO. #WIP#",

            "text": "Ubuntu\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis guide attempts to explain how to manually install SeAT onto an \nUbuntu\n Server. A small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, although it is not entirely mandatory.\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe are going to assume you have root access to a fresh Ubuntu Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \naptitude\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\n\n\nEve Application and ESI\nSeAT 3.0 consumes CCP's \nESI\n service in order to retrieve EVE Online related information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to register a third party EVE application on the developers portal. This is an absolute must for SeAT to be of any use. The configuration of this step is covered in a later stage of the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nOperating System\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore we get to installing SeAT, lets ensure that your operating system is up to date. We can do that with basics :\n\n\n\n\napt-get update\n to refresh the repositories cache.\n\n\napt-get full-upgrade\n to update any installed packages.\n\n\nreboot\n in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version.\n\n\napt-get autoremove\n (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.\n\n\nThis document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.\n\n\nWe need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Lets add this repository with:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup \n|\n bash\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the repository now setup, lets install the database server:\n\n\n\n\nWarning\nDuring the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the \nroot\n MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\napt-get install mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password (if you have not been prompted for it yet).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. If you already set a \nroot\n password in the previous step then you dont have to set it again, otherwise, make sure you choose a long, strong password for the \nroot\n account. An example run is shown below:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nEnter current password \nfor\n root \n(\nenter \nfor\n none\n)\n:  IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nSet root password? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove \ntest\n database and access to it? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.\n\n\nNext, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the \nmysql\n command line client and enter a few commands as the \nroot\n user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the \nmysql\n client as root by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\n\n\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\nroot@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with \n;\n or \n\\g\n.\nYour MariaDB connection id is \n16\n\nCopyright \n(\nc\n)\n \n2000\n, \n2018\n, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.\n\nType \n'help;'\n or \n'\\h'\n \nfor\n help. Type \n'\\c'\n to clear the current input statement.\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n>\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new database for SeAT to use with:\n\n\ncreate database seat\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n> create database seat\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n1\n row affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we  need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own unique and strong password.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB \n[(\nnone\n)]\n> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n0\n rows affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as \nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\n\n\nFinally, we will flush the database server privileges:\n\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with \nexit\n;\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT is written primarily in PHP, we will need to install PHP packages. Currently only PHP 7.1 is supported due to issues with Laravel (the framework SeAT is built on) and PHP 7.2. This should change in the very near future. Ubuntu based systems can make use of the \nondrej PPA\n which is a very popular repository used for specific PHP versions.\n\n\nDepending on the version of Ubuntu you are using, a release specific repository URL should be used for the PPA. Select the tab applicable to your Ubuntu version and run the commands within.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nXenial 16.04\n\n  \nArtful 17.10\n\n  \nBionic 18.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\necho \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\necho \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\necho \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\necho \"deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will have to download the new repositories GPG signing key and add it into our keychain\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 4F4EA0AAE5267A6C\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the new repository configured, update the package lists with:\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, install the required PHP packages with:\n\n\napt-get install curl zip php7.1-cli php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-intl php7.1-curl php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring php7.1-bz2 php7.1-dom php7.1-zip\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\napt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nExcellent progress! All of the operating system level requirements are now met and we are almost ready to install SeAT itself. The only thing that is outstanding is the package manager called \ncomposer\n as well as the \ngit\n client. The combination of \ncomposer\n and \ngit\n will let us download the SeAT source code from Github and install it locally.\n\n\nGit\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstall \ngit\n with:\n\n\napt-get install git\n\n\n\n\n\nComposer\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, install \ncomposer\n with:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer \n|\n php -- --install-dir\n=\n/usr/local/bin --filename\n=\ncomposer \n&&\n \nhash\n -r\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it. Lets install SeAT! By default, we suggest you run SeAT from within \n/var/www/seat\n. As part of the installation, the \nseat\n directory will be created for us, but we will need to create \n/var/www\n for now as we have not yet configured the web server.\n\n\nCreate the \nwww\n directory with:\n\n\nmkdir -p /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, \ncd\n to the new \n/var/www\n directory with:\n\n\ncd\n /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith all of the prerequisites installed as well as our \nwww\n directory ready we can finally download SeAT. Do that with:\n\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev --stability\n=\nbeta\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the download is done, you should have seen output such as:\n\n\nWriting lock file\nGenerating optimized autoload files\n> Illuminate\n\\F\noundation\n\\C\nomposerScripts::postAutoloadDump\n> @php artisan package:discover\nDiscovered Package: darkaonline/l5-swagger\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/api\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/console\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/eveapi\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/notifications\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/services\nDiscovered Package: eveseat/web\nPackage manifest generated successfully.\n> @php artisan key:generate\nApplication key \n[\nbase64:CmhqYNkaIcHo8nYC8LiEWa3U5/+BiTLih5dZftxlV2k\n=]\n \nset\n successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou may have noticed a warning about \ncomposer\n running as \nroot\n. For now this can be safely ignored. Post the installation of the SeAT source code, we need to fix up the permissions of the downloaded files. Do that with:\n\n\nchown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/seat\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that the web server, cron jobs and workers have access to the source code as well as logs.\n\n\nSeAT Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith SeAT downloaded, we need to configure it. There are a number of configuration tasks needed. These include editing the applications \n.env\n file as well as running some commands that setup and seed the database. A configuration value reference can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n.env setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe first task would be to configure the applications database connection. Open the file located at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n with something like \nvi\n or \nnano\n and update the database options with your values. Typically, only the password would really need to be updated. If you are making use of an existing database somewhere else over the network, update the applicable fields such as \nDB_HOST\n accordingly.\n\n\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\n\n\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\n\n\nDB_PORT=3306\n\n\nDB_DATABASE=seat\n\n\nDB_USERNAME=seat\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n \n# <-- this is the value you probably need to edit.\n\n\nDB_DEBUG=false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Migrations and Seeds\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext we need to publish the database migrations and web assets (such as JavaScript scripts and CSS Style sheets), run those migrations and finally seed the SeAT job schedule.\n\n\nPublish the assets and database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the database migrations with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed the SeAT schedule with:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVE Sde Update\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of a number of tables from the EVE \nStatic Data Exports\n. MySQL conversions of this data is available at \nhttps://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/\n and used in SeAT.\n\n\nTo update to the \nlatest SDE\n within SeAT, run:\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe jobs ecosystem within SeAT requires a process supervisor to ensure that the job runner stays alive. The job runner itself is implemented using \nLaravel Horizon\n and is monitored using \nsupervisord\n.\n\n\nTo configure the Horizon process monitor, first install \nsupervisor\n:\n\n\napt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. This file will live in \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf\n. Create this file with its recommended configuration with:\n\n\ncat > /etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf \n<< EOL\n\n\n[program:seat]\n\n\ncommand=/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon\n\n\nprocess_name = %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d\n\n\nstdout_logfile = /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log\n\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB\n\n\nstdout_logfile_backups=10\n\n\nnumprocs=1\n\n\ndirectory=/var/www/seat\n\n\nstopwaitsecs=600\n\n\nuser=www-data\n\n\nEOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload supervisor to apply the new configuration with the following command:\n\n\nsystemctl restart supervisor.service\n\n\n\n\n\nCrontab\n\u00b6\n\n\nA crontab entry is needed for SeAT. While simple in implementation, this crontab entry simply helps the application invoke a job checker very minute. The \nactual\n schedule is stored within SeAT itself and managed entirely via the Web Interface.\n\n\nTo configure the crontab entry required for SeAT, run the following commands:\n\n\necho\n \n'* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1'\n > /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, add this crontab for the \nwww-data\n user with:\n\n\ncrontab -u www-data /tmp/seat-crontab.tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to confirm that the crontab successfully installed, you can check it with \ncrontab -u www-data -l\n.\n\n\nWeb Server\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAlmost there!\nYou almost made it to the end! Just one more step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly recommend you to use \nnginx\n and will be covered in this document. You don't \nhave\n to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nNginx Install\n\u00b6\n\n\nTogether with an \nnginx\n installation we also need to install \nphp-fpm\n to handle the PHP execution for us. Let's install \nnginx\n and \nphp-fpm\n with:\n\n\napt-get install nginx php7.1-fpm\n\n\n\n\n\nNginx Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the webserver installed, we need to configure \nnginx\n to serve SeAT. For that, a configuration file needs to be created that will tell \nnginx\n where to find \nphp-fpm\n as well as where the assets are for SeAT.\n\n\nThe configuration file will live at \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n. It can be created with the following command:\n\n\ncat > /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat \n<< EOL\n\n\nserver {\n\n\n\n    listen 80;\n\n\n    listen [::]:80;\n\n\n\n    # If you are hosting this instance on a domain, set that\n\n\n    # name here.\n\n\n    #server_name  seat.yourdomain.com;\n\n\n\n    # SeAT public directory. This is the only directory that\n\n\n    # should be exposed by the webserver. If one has to expose\n\n\n    # the parent directory then things like the .env file will\n\n\n    # be available for anyone to download.\n\n\n    root /var/www/seat/public;\n\n\n\n    index index.php;\n\n\n\n    location / {\n\n\n       try_files \\$uri \\$uri/ /index.php?\\$query_string;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # PHP-FPM configuration.\n\n\n    location ~ \\.php\\$ {\n\n\n       try_files \\$uri /index.php =404;\n\n\n       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock;\n\n\n       fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \\$document_root\\$fastcgi_script_name;\n\n\n       include fastcgi_params;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # Even though .htaccess rules mean nothing in the nginx\n\n\n    # world, prevent those from being downloaded anyways.\n\n\n    location ~ /\\.ht {\n\n\n       deny all;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n\n    # In case someone messes up, prevent .env files from\n\n\n    # being downloaded as well.\n\n\n    location ~ /\\.env {\n\n\n       deny all;\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\nEOL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration file as is at \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n itself won't be loaded by \nnginx\n yet. Storing configuration files in a \n*sites-available*\n directory is simply a convention used to allow administrators to quickly add & remove sites if needed. To \napply\n the changes made by the new configuration file it needs to be symlinked to a \n*sites-enabled*\n directory.\n\n\nLet's symlink to the new configuration and drop the default one as a hardening exercise at the same time:\n\n\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat\nrm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload \nnginx\n and \nphp-fpm\n for the new changes to take affect:\n\n\nsystemctl restart nginx.service\nsystemctl restart php7.1-fpm.service\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin Login\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT 3.0, an admin user is a special user and can no longer link characters or corporations to it. Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the Superuser group and never login as an admin again.\n\n\nTo login as an administrator, simply run the following command :\n\n\nsudo -H -u www-data bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow:\n\n\nroot@ubuntu:/var/www/seat# sudo -H -u www-data bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\nSeAT Admin Login URL Generator\nUser 'admin' does not exist. It will be created.\nSearching for the 'Superuser' role\nCreating the Superuser role\nChecking if the Superuser role has the superuser permission\nAdding the superuser permission to the role\nChecking if 'admin' is a super user\nAdding 'admin' to the Superuser role\nGenerating authentication token\n\nYour authentication URL is valid for 60 seconds.\nhttp://localhost/auth/login/admin/9G3sb8hjMvrbIJrIf10KKtIj1c8e9mL5\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy it and paste it inside your browser and you will be authenticated as the admin user.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\nIf you have not configured the \nAPP_URL\n setting in the \n.env\n file, then the admin url will be generated for \nlocalhost\n. This is most likely incorrect and you can simply replace \nlocalhost\n with your IP address or domain name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESI Configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the guide, it is necessary for you to configure ESI. FOr instructions now how to do this, please refer to the \nESI Setup Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nYou made it! Use a browser and browse to the IP address / hostname of your server to access SeAT!",

            "text": "SeAT relies  heavily  on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.  We need to ensure that we have the latest MariaDB installed. To help with this, MariaDB provides an official repository to get the latest versions. Lets add this repository with:  curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup  |  bash  With the repository now setup, lets install the database server:   Warning During the installation, you may be asked to set a password for the  root  MariaDB user account. Make sure you set a long, strong password and remember it. It will be needed for the next step.    apt-get install mariadb-server  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password (if you have not been prompted for it yet).   Note  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also share be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions where you should generally just answer yes to. If you already set a  root  password in the previous step then you dont have to set it again, otherwise, make sure you choose a long, strong password for the  root  account. An example run is shown below:  [ ... ] \n\nEnter current password  for  root  ( enter  for  none ) :  IF ONE WAS SET, IGNORE THIS\nOK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] \n\nSet root password?  [ Y/n ]  y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove anonymous users?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nDisallow root login remotely?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove  test  database and access to it?  [ Y/n ]  y [ ... ] \n\nReload privilege tables now?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.  Next, we need to create an actual user and database for SeAT to use on the newly installed server. To do this we use the  mysql  command line client and enter a few commands as the  root  user to create the database and the user that will be accessing the server. Let get to it.  Fire up the  mysql  client as root by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)  If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  root@ubuntu:~# mysql -uroot -p\nEnter password:\nWelcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with  ;  or  \\g .\nYour MariaDB connection id is  16 \nCopyright  ( c )   2000 ,  2018 , Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.\n\nType  'help;'  or  '\\h'   for  help. Type  '\\c'  to clear the current input statement.\n\nMariaDB  [( none )] >  Create a new database for SeAT to use with:  create database seat ;   The output should be similar to the below:  MariaDB  [( none )] > create database seat ; \nQuery OK,  1  row affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   Next, we  need to create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the new  seat  database:  GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ;   Of course, you need to replace  s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd  with your own unique and strong password.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:  MariaDB  [( none )] > GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; \nQuery OK,  0  rows affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as  seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .  Finally, we will flush the database server privileges:  FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;   That concludes the database server setup. You can exit the prompt with  exit ;   Note  Remember the password for the  seat  database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.",

If your \ndocker-compose.yml\n lives in \n/opt/seat-docker\n, you will need to \ncd\n to that directory first and then execute the \ndocker-compose\n commands.\n\n\nContainer Status\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor a quick, birds-eye view on the status of the containers within the SeAT docker stack, the following command may be run:\n\n\ndocker-compose ps\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should give you the name, entry point, current status and internal ports used within the docker network as output.\n\n\nAdmin Login\n\u00b6\n\n\nAdministrative access to SeAT has changed dramatically since version 3.

Configuration options such as your applications SSO secrets, SeAT's web server ports are amongst the many configuration options available in this file.\n\n\nMaking changes to this file requires the docker stack to be restarted so that the configuration may be applies. An example case would be when you \nconfigure SSO\n for your instance.\n\n\nOnce you have made a configuration change, save the \n.env\n file and restart the stack by simply running the following command from the path where the \ndocker-compose.yml\n lives:\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Container Logs\n\u00b6\n\n\nGetting an idea of what is happening inside of the containers may be useful for many things, including debugging any issues that may occur. All of the containers generate logs that can be viewed either in isolation, or all of the containers in the stack.\n\n\nTo view a single containers logs (\nseat-app\n in this examples case), run:\n\n\ndocker-compose logs --tail \n10\n -f seat-app\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view all containers logs at once, run:\n\n\ndocker-compose logs --tail \n10\n -f\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are done viewing the output, simply pressing ^C will exit the log viewer.\n\n\nInstalling Plugins\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT provides the ability for third party developers to integrate with the core environment to extend its features and functionality. It is possible to install those plugins in a docker environment. Installing a plugin is relatively easy too. All you need to do is add the plugin name to your \nSEAT_PLUGINS\n variable in the \n.env\n file and run \ndocker-compose up -d\n again. The plugin will be read from the \n.env\n file and installed as the application container starts.\n\n\nFor example. Open the \n.env\n file (which is most probably at \n/opt/seat-docker/.env\n) and edit the \nSEAT_PLUGINS\n variable to include the package you want to install. In our example we use the pseudo package called user/seat-plugin:\n\n\n# SeAT Plugins\n\n\n# This is a list of the all of the third party plugins that you\n\n\n# would like to install as part of SeAT. Package names should be\n\n\n# comma separated if multiple packages should be installed.\n\n\nSEAT_PLUGINS=user/seat-plugin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your \n.env\n file and run \ndocker-compose up -d\n to restart the stack with the new plugins as part of it. Depending on how big the plugin itself may be, this could take a few moments to complete.\n\n\nYou can monitor the installation process by running:\n\n\ndocker-compose logs --tail \n5\n -f seat-app\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Backups and Restore\n\u00b6\n\n\nBackups. They are important and really simple to do. To perform a backup of the current database used within the docker stack, run:\n\n\ndocker-compose \nexec\n mariadb sh -c \n'exec mysqldump \"$MYSQL_DATABASE\" -u\"$MYSQL_USER\" -p\"$MYSQL_PASSWORD\"'\n > seat_backup.sql\n\n\n\n\n\nTo restore a backup to a new dockerized instance of SeAT, run:\n\n\ncat seat_backup.sql \n|\n docker-compose \nexec\n -T mariadb sh -c \n'exec mysql \"$MYSQL_DATABASE\" -u\"$MYSQL_USER\" -p\"$MYSQL_PASSWORD\"'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming Updates\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs expected, updates for SeAT are deployed via Dockerhub and the images within the \neveseat organization\n. Every package version release will automatically start the build process to generate a new docker image. This means updates are suuuper simple in the docker world. To update your instance, simply run:\n\n\n# Update to the latest dockerhub images\n\ndocker-compose pull\n\n\n# Apply the updates to your instllation\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n# Cleanup any dangling images\n\ndocker image prune -f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter safe then sorry\n\n\nAlways\n perform a \nbackup\n of your database before doing an update.

This allows for SeAT administrators to granularly control who has access to what based on which roles a SeAT user has.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis section aims to clear up the definitions used in the SeAT RBAC (Role-based Access Control) implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\nA SeAT user account. This can be either a user account that was created in SeAT itself, or an automatically created account based on SSO. The only difference between the accounts is that with an SSO account, SeAT has no idea what the accounts password is. Otherwise, everything else is exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission\n\nA Permission is an attribute that is assigned to a \nRole\n. It grants access based on the specific permission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\n\nA Role is simply a collection of permissions. Users get assigned a roles and inherit the permissions granted by that role. A user can not be given a raw permission. Permissions can only be granted my creating a Role, assigning permissions to the Role and granting the role to a user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliation\n\nAffiliations allow administrators to set permissions bound to a specific entity. When configuring a role, permissions are granted to the role. When the an affiliation is set, the role effectively gives the permissions to the specified entities in the affiliation list. Not all roles are affected by affiliations. By default, only Corporation and Character roles are affected by affiliations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntity\n\nAn entity is either a Character or a Corporation identified by its unique ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\u00b6\n\n\nCorporation accountant\n\u00b6\n\n\nLets assume you wanted to create a role for a corporation accountant. To acheive this, you would do the following:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new role. Name it something like \nCorporation Accountant\n.\n\n\nEdit the new role, and grant it the \nCorporation.ledger\n, \nCorporation.walletJournal\n, \nCorporation.transactions\n and \nCorporation.summary\n (to view the sheet) permissions.\n\n\nNext, affiliate the role with the corporation(s) for whom this role should act as an accountant.\n\n\nOptionally, assign some users to the role. You can assign users at a later stage too.\n\n\n\n\nYour configured role from the above example may now look as follows:\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe next list is a short definition of what the currently available permissions are and which sections of SeAT they grant access to.

This means, every package has a service provider.\nAll a service provider really is, is a class with 2 methods ie: \nhandle()\n and \nregister()\n.\nWhen a service provider is bootstrapped into the application, these 2 methods are called at some stage.\n\n\nIt is in these methods that we tell the Laravel framework more about our package.\nAmongst many things that we can tell it, one of them is configuration related.\nAll we really telling the application is where the configuration file is, and under which namespace does it live.\nAnother important fact is that SeAT package configurations are added with the \nmergeConfigFrom()\n method.\nThis means, you can override the defaults in your installation without worrying about breaking the package itself.\n\n\nOverriding configuration\n\u00b6\n\n\nLets take a look at a sample package configuration file: The \neveseat/eveapi package\n for example.\nAt the time of this writing, it has 5 configuration options.

This guide applies to any other installation type only.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Upgrades\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs with anything, it is a \nvery\n good idea to have backups ready before attempting any upgrades. In the case of SeAT, the most important component that needs to be backed up is the SeAT database. In short, something as simple as \nmysqldump -uroot -p seat > backup.sql\n should be perfectly fine. Should something go wrong, then you can simply re-install SeAT, restore the database and you should be good to go.\n\n\nUpgrade Options\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are 2 ways to upgrade SeAT. The recommended way being the \nseat\n tool and then the manual way when you are not using a docker-based installed. For most cases the \nseat\n tool should be fine as it tries to auto detect things for you, however, if you edited the defaults or installed on some custom operating system, then you may need to upgrade manually.\n\n\nUpgrading using the seat tool\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll you need to do is run the upgrade command and all will be done for you. Follow the next steps to get this done:\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't downloaded the \nseat\n tool yet, do so now by running:\n\n\n\n\ncurl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-tool -o /usr/local/bin/seat \n&&\n chmod +x /usr/local/bin/seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have the \nseat\n tool downloaded, make sure the tool itself is at its latest version. Do this by running: \nseat update:self\n.\n\n\nIf you have not yet backed up your database, do so now! This is the only part that \ncan not\n be recovered in case something goes wrong!\n\n\nEnsure that the job queue is empty.\n\n\nUpgrade SeAT by running: \nseat update:seat\n.\n\n\n\n\nManually upgrading\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you cant or don't want to use the SeAT tool, follow these steps to upgrade SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you are in the path where you installed. By default this should be \n/var/www/seat\n.\n\n\nPut your application into maintenance mode. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts a good thing to update \ncomposer\n itself. This is not a hard requirement, but definitely recommended. Do this with:\n\n\n\n\ncomposer self-update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing to do is get the latest SeAT packages. The below example adds the \n--no-dev\n argument as these packages are generally not needed in production. Upgrade the packages with:\n\n\n\n\ncomposer update --no-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the packages upgraded, we can now publish any new migrations/assets/configs. This can be done with:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan vendor:publish --force --all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the needed files are published, run any new/outstanding migrations with:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the migrations done, run the seeders to update any static data:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan db:seed --class\n=\nSeat\n\\\\\nServices\n\\\\\ndatabase\n\\\\\nseeds\n\\\\\nScheduleSeeder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart the supervisor workers to ensure they also pickup the latest code:\n\n\n\n\nsupervisorctl restart all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can simply bring our application back out of maintenance mode with:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan up",

This is mainly due to the number of fundamental changes that were made in the SeAT 2.x release.\n\n\nNotes on the upgrade\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe way SeAT is structured has not changed much since its version 1x days. The biggest change is a Laravel framework upgrade to version 5.3. This introduced a new base layout for the application which is why the manual upgrade is needed.\n\n\nThe upgrade process has a large amount of database migrations that need to run so grab a coffee depending on how big your database is!\n\n\nRequirements\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nSeAT 2.0 requires PHP 7.0. At the time of writing this document, PHP 7.1 is not supported due to bug in PhealNG (the component SeAT uses to talk to the EVE API).\n\n\nMySQL 5.7 is recommended but not required.\n\n\nA database backup is an absolute \nmust\n. Everything in SeAT can be recovered is some way or form \nexcept for your database\n. Make 100% sure you backed this up before proceeding with the upgrade!\n\n\nTake note of where SeAT is installed. This is usually in \n/var/www/seat\n.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade procedure\n\u00b6\n\n\nPreparation\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf users are using your SeAT instance, or the workers are churning away in the background, then you may risk losing some information (although unlikely). Its therefore recommended that you start by putting SeAT into maintenance mode before starting the upgrade. Do this by running the following command in your SeAT path.\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www/seat\n$ php artisan down\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the message \nApplication is now in maintenance mode.\n.\n\n\nBackups\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nMake a backup of your SeAT database and store it somewhere safe! \nDo not skip this step!\n\n\nIn your SeAT directory, make a copy of the \n.env\n file. This file contains all of your SeAT configuration. These values are needed to reconnect to the database once SeAT 2.0 is installed.\n\n\n\n\nPhp 7\n\u00b6\n\n\nInstall PHP7 if you don't have it already. You can check your PHP version by running \nphp -v\n:\n\n\n$ php -v\nPHP \n7\n.0.14 \n(\ncli\n)\n \n(\nbuilt: Dec  \n7\n \n2016\n \n10\n:25:25\n)\n \n(\n NTS \n)\n\nCopyright \n(\nc\n)\n \n1997\n-2016 The PHP Group\nZend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright \n(\nc\n)\n \n1998\n-2016 Zend Technologies\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the new code\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT 2.0 can be installed in exactly the same place as where you had your v1.x installation. If you reuse this path then no webserver re-configuration will be needed. We will move the old installation out of the way, and install SeAT 2.0. To do this, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, move the old installation out of the way:\n\n\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www\n$ mv seat seat.old\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can double check that this was successful by running \nls\n and ensuring that there is a folder named \nseat.old\n now.\n\n\n\n\nNext, get the new SeAT code by running \ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\n:\n\n\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www\n$ composer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\nInstalling eveseat/seat \n(\n2\n.0.0\n)\n\n  - Installing eveseat/seat \n(\n2\n.0.0\n)\n\n    Loading from cache\n\nCreated project in seat\n> php -r \n\"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\"\n\nLoading composer repositories with package information\nUpdating dependencies\n\n\n[\n ... snip ... \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish the assets\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we need to publish the new SeAT 2.0 CSS & Javascript and database migrations. This can be done with \nphp artisan vendor:publish --force\n.\n\n\nReconfigure \n.env\n file\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the new code ready to use, the next thing that is required is to reconnect the database. Remember that \n.env\n file you backed up earlier? Refer to it for the values needed in the newly installed env file that can be found at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n.\n\n\nImportant keys to populate with the correct values are:\n\n\nDB_HOST\n=\n\n\nDB_PORT\n=\n\n\nDB_DATABASE\n=\n\n\nDB_USERNAME\n=\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT 2.0 introduced new configuration items in the \n.env\n that you can review. There is also the option to configure Supervisor & SeAT integration, which can be done by following the admin guide titled \nSeAT & Supervisor Integration\n.\n\n\nRun migrations\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the database reconnected, its time to run the migrations for SeAT 2.0. This is the part that may take some time, depending on how big your database is.\n\n\nTo run the migrations, make sure you are still in your seat path (\n/var/www/seat\n) and run \nphp artisan migrate\n:\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www/seat\n$ php artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a bunch of messages and eventually your shell prompt again, indicating that it has completed. If you receive errors here, double check that you have entered the correct database settings in the \n.env\n file previously mentioned.\n\n\nDatabase seeders\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the database migration complete, its time to seed it with some of the static data SeAT needs. Do this with the following commands:\n\n\nphp artisan db:seed --class\n=\nSeat\n\\\\\nNotifications\n\\\\\ndatabase\n\\\\\nseeds\n\\\\\nScheduleSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class\n=\nSeat\n\\\\\nServices\n\\\\\ndatabase\n\\\\\nseeds\n\\\\\nNotificationTypesSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class\n=\nSeat\n\\\\\nServices\n\\\\\ndatabase\n\\\\\nseeds\n\\\\\nScheduleSeeder\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate worker jobs\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Laravel 5.3 upgrade in SeAT changed the way worker jobs are started. You can edit the command used to start a worker in your \nseat.conf\n file in supervisor. Normally, this file will be somewhere like in \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/\n.\n\n\nThe only line you really need to edit is the one that starts with \ncommand\n, replacing it with:\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:work --queue\n=\nhigh,medium,low,default --tries \n1\n --timeout\n=\n86100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full block for SeAT 2.0 should therefore be:\n\n\n[\nprogram:seat\n]\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:work --queue\n=\nhigh,medium,low,default --tries \n1\n --timeout\n=\n86100\n\n\nprocess_name\n \n=\n %\n(\nprogram_name\n)\ns-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d\n\nstdout_logfile\n \n=\n /var/log/seat-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d.log\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes\n=\n100MB\n\nstdout_logfile_backups\n=\n10\n\n\nnumprocs\n=\n4\n\n\ndirectory\n=\n/var/www/seat\n\nstopwaitsecs\n=\n600\n\n\nuser\n=\nwww-data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nKeep in mind the \nuser\n value and the path to \nartisan\n should be correct.\nUpdate them to the correct values of you made changes to the defaults.\nThe \nuser\n value differs many times based on Linux distribution too!\n\n\n\n\nFinishing off\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith all of that done, bring your application back up with \nphp artisan up\n and start the supervisor workers again.\nWatch the logs for any errors in case things have not gone as expected.\nIf you need any help, feel free to join the Slack channel details in the \nContact\n page on the left.",

For eg: monitor.{yourdomain.com}\n\n\n\n\nThe password hash format used by the dashboard is a 1000 thousand iteration MD5 sum. To generate such a password hash you need to install a helper utility first. On Ubuntu, this can be done with:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install apache2-utils\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, generate the password hash with \nhtpasswd\n. Substitute \nsecure_password\n with the password you'd like to use for the Tr\u00e6fik admin user:\n\n\nhtpasswd -nb admin secure_password\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command will output a hash similar to the below format:\n\n\nadmin:\n$apr1$ruca84Hq$mbjdMZBAG\n.KWn7vfN/SNK/\n\n\n\n\n\nTake this output and replace the \nusers = [admin:MD5Password]\n section in the Traefik \n.toml\n.",

You can resolve them by adding them to your  composer.json  and running  composer update .",

This guide was written while writing the API package for SeAT \nhere\n. I figured it would be best to try and capture the process to help in case I miss any important details.\n\n\nBackground notes\n\u00b6\n\n\nI think its important to keep in mind a few things about how SeAT is put together. The most important being a brief description of what each core package offers, and how you can integrate with them. For a breakdown on what the core packages provide, please refer the to breakdown \nhere\n.\n\n\nSeAT 3 is written on \nLaravel 5.5\n. A \nvery\n good thing to do would be to actually read the documentation top->bottom and get an idea of what is possible with the framework. SeAT core packages make heavy use of many of the features, based directly of what has been interpreted by this very documentation.\n\n\nIf you really want to start contributing packages, but juts cant get your head around this whole Laravel thing, then I can suggest you have a look at this excellent free course material covering the basics of what you will encounter in the SeAT codebase. \nhttps://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals\n\n\nBest practices\n\u00b6\n\n\nNo doubt, there are no limits to what code you can write, how you structure it and how you name things. However, the last thing you want is to have conflicts with the SeAT core, or someone elses package! The following list contains some tips to help you avoid those conflicts and to help people better discover your packages:\n\n\n\n\nPrefix your github repository name with \nseat\n eg: \nseat-teamspeak\n.\n\n\nTag your github repository with \nseat\n.\n\n\nUse a unique package namespace such as \nAuthor\\Seat\\Package\\\n eg: \nWarlof\\Seat\\Teamspeak\\\n.\n\n\nPrefix your database table names with something unique to your package. eg \nwarlof_teamspeak_users\n.\n\n\nDo not modify core tables. This will break future updates for users of your package.\n\n\nPrefix your settings with both an author and package eg: \nwarlof.teamspeak.address\n.\n\n\nPrefix redis records with both author and package eg: \nwarlof.teamspeak.channels\n.\n\n\nIn your \ncomposer.json\n file, set the \ntype\n to \nseat-plugin\n.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe very first thing to do is prepare the empty git repository on say Github, as well as the composer package itself. Clone a clean repository, and run \ncomposer init\n, answering any questions. Once that is done, edit the resultant \ncomposer.json\n and prepare the \nautoload\n block. SeAT core follows the \nPSR-4\n autoloading standard. I will suggest you do the same. For some more detailed composer info, refer to the docs \nhere\n. For the API package, I am going to autoload \nSeat\\Api\n from the \nsrc\n directory using PSR-4.\n\n\nService provider\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs mentioned in the package breakdowns \nhere\n, the \neveseat/seat\n repository bootstraps packages via service providers or package discovery. This is actually a Laravel convention that SeAT just follows. To get our package ready, we need to create a service provider. Thankfully there is a command to stub a new one for us. For the API package, I just ran \nphp artisan make:provider ApiServiceProvider\n and copied the resultant file from \napp/Providers\n to my packages \nsrc/\n directory. Our packages file structure now looks as follows:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage structure\n\u00b6\n\n\nFrom here you pretty much free to do what you want. How you structure the package will obviously depend on what exactly your package provides. In principle, I prefer to follow the same package structure as Laravel does for web / console features. Since we are going to be providing web features with the API, we will quickly create a few folders in preparation for this. I know beforehand that we are going to need a model to store API tokens; middleware to authenticate API requests; routes and controllers for the actual api logic (preferably making use of the \neveapi/services\n repository classes for data access) as well as a few web views for administrators to generate API tokens for applications. With that in mind, the initial structure looks as follows:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Config\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Http\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Middleware\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Models\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 database\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 migrations\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 resources\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 views\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will obviously change as we progress building the package.\n\n\nRoutes and controllers\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo start testing the API, we need to add a route and controller to process some requests and responses. My \nroutes.php\n file will have a global \nRoute::group()\n to encapsulate the routes in the \nSeat\\Api\n namespace as well as prefix them with \napi/\n.\n\n\n// File: routes.php\n\n\nRoute::group([ 'namespace' => 'Seat\\Api\\Http\\Controllers',\n\n\n    'prefix' => 'api'\n\n\n], function () {\n\n\n\n    // Logic here\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the final product \nhere\n for a more complete example.\n\n\nNext, I add some logic with a route to \n/\n, update the base frameworks \ncomposer.json\n to autoload the \nSeat\\Api\n namespace from the directory where my package lives, run \ncomposer dump-autoload\n and add the service provider to the \neveseat/seat\n repositories \napp.php\n providers array. Lastly, I add a method to the service provider to load the routes and call it form the \nboot()\n method in the generated stub.\n\n\nSee the complete service provider \nhere\n\n\n/**\n\n\n* Include the routes\n\n\n*/\n\n\npublic function add_routes()\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n    if (!$this->app->routesAreCached()) {\n\n\n        include __DIR__ . '/Http/routes.php';\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a final test, I check that my route is accessible from a booted SeAT app. :)  \n\n\nRoutes\n\u00b6\n\n\nAccess Control\n\u00b6\n\n\nObviously, some routes are not for everyone's eyes. SeAT comes with middleware that can be used to filter out requests that may not be authorized for your route. As can be seen in the example below (from \nhere\n), we are filtering out requests to \napi-admin\n for only superusers.\n\n\nRoute::group([\n\n\n        'namespace'  => 'Admin',\n\n\n        'middleware' => 'bouncer:superuser', // The ACL specification.\n\n\n        'prefix'     => 'api-admin'\n\n\n    ], function () {\n\n\n        Route::get('/', [\n\n\n            'as'   => 'api-admin.list',\n\n\n            'uses' => 'ApiAdminController@listTokens']);\n\n\n    });\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest you have a look at the \neveseat/web\n packages routes definitions for more examples on how the middleware is used. \nhttps://github.com/eveseat/web/tree/master/src/Http/Routes\n\n\nMiddleware\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo auth our API requests, we are going to go with token based authentication for now. We want users to present us with a \nX-Token\n header (from a valid allowed src IP address) before they may proceed with their request. To do this, we will filter requests using middleware. Thankfully, again, Laravel comes with a command to stub us some empty middleware. Run \nphp artisan make:middleware ApiToken\n and copy it to your projects \nMiddleware\n folder. Next we should register the middleware in our service provider. I do this by adding a method and calling it in \nboot()\n.\n\n\nSee the complete middleware \nhere\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * Include the middleware needed\n\n\n *\n\n\n * @param $router\n\n\n */\n\n\npublic function add_middleware($router)\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n    // Authenticate checks that the token is valid\n\n\n    // from an allowed IP address\n\n\n    $router->middleware('api.auth', ApiToken::class);\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlthough almost all of our interfacing with this package will be via the json api endpoints, we need to add a few routes that will give an administrator the ability to generate API tokens as well as view logs etc. This will be for an administrator, so we will re-use the ACL features provided by the \neveseat/web\n package to ensure that only admins an access our api-admin routes. Views live in \nresources/views\n and are bootstrapped to the \napi\n namespace in the service provider. See the service provider \nhere\n for an example.\n\n\nNote how we are re-using views that exist in the \nweb\n namespace. All we have to do is extend one of the \ngrids\n like \nhere\n and start without our blade template.\n\n\nSidebar menu\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the sidebar is also really easy. All you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The config file itself has a set structure for the \nweb\n package to interpret and can be seen \nhere\n.\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    'api' => [\n\n\n        'permission'    => 'Superuser',\n\n\n        'name'          => 'Api Tokens',\n\n\n        'icon'          => 'fa-exchange',\n\n\n        'route_segment' => 'api-admin',\n\n\n        'entries'       => [\n\n\n            [   // Manage API Tokens\n\n\n                'name'  => 'Manage',\n\n\n                'icon'  => 'fa-key',\n\n\n                'route' => 'api-admin.list'\n\n\n            ]\n\n\n        ]\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe format is generally an array, whereby the first key is the name of your package (\napi\n in this case). Thereafter you can specify the main entry, and any sub entries you want to add. The \nroute\n key should refer to the named route. The sidebar loader will resolve the route itself for you. If you have any permissions requirements for your package, the \npermission\n key can be used together with a required SeAT permission to render the view.\n\n\nCharacter submenus\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the character sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named \npackage.character.menu\n in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below:\n\n\n// file: package.character.menu.php\n\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    [\n\n\n        'name'           => 'Research',\n\n\n        'permission'     => 'character.research',\n\n\n        'highlight_view' => 'research',\n\n\n        'route'          => 'character.view.research'\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporation submenus\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the corporation sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar and character menus, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named \npackage.corporation.menu\n in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below:\n\n\n// file: package.corporation.menu.php\n\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    [\n\n\n        'name'           => 'Research',\n\n\n        'permission'     => 'corporation.research',\n\n\n        'highlight_view' => 'research',\n\n\n        'route'          => 'corporation.view.research'\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrapping menu items\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the above items, we refer to the files needing to be \nbootstrapped\n via the service provider. All this really means is that we have to tell the Laravel application where to find configuration information for a namespace. So, if we wanted to add a sidebar item, we would add the following line to the \nregister()\n method of the service provider:\n\n\n// Include this packages menu items\n\n\n$this->mergeConfigFrom(__DIR__ . '/Config/package.sidebar.php', 'package.sidebar');\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the file with the sidebar definitions, the second is the namespace.\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor our API package, we have a database requirement. We need to store api tokens and the ip address that is allowed to use them. We are also going to store an access log (based on the config setting). We create migrations and models just like you would for a base Laravel 5.1 application. The only thing to remember is that your migrations for your package must be published (and specified in your service provider).",

This is actually a Laravel convention that SeAT just follows. To get our package ready, we need to create a service provider. Thankfully there is a command to stub a new one for us. For the API package, I just ran  php artisan make:provider ApiServiceProvider  and copied the resultant file from  app/Providers  to my packages  src/  directory. Our packages file structure now looks as follows:  \u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php",

In principle, I prefer to follow the same package structure as Laravel does for web / console features. Since we are going to be providing web features with the API, we will quickly create a few folders in preparation for this. I know beforehand that we are going to need a model to store API tokens; middleware to authenticate API requests; routes and controllers for the actual api logic (preferably making use of the  eveapi/services  repository classes for data access) as well as a few web views for administrators to generate API tokens for applications. With that in mind, the initial structure looks as follows:  \u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Config\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Http\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Middleware\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Models\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 database\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 migrations\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 resources\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 views  This will obviously change as we progress building the package.",
