Examples of such providers are \nDigital Ocean\n, \nLinode\n and \nVultr\n.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Container Setup Overview\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe setup for SeAT's docker installation is built on top of \ndocker-compose\n. With docker-compose, we can use a single \ndocker-compose.yml\n file to define the entire stack complete with dependencies required to run SeAT. A pre-built and recommended compose file (which is also used by the bootstrapping script) is hosted in the scripts repository \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe previously mentioned compose file is really simple. A high level overview of its contents is:\n\n\n\n\nA single docker network called \nseat-network\n is defined. All containers are connected to this network and is used as the primary means for inter-container communications.\n\n\nThree volumes are configured to store data. Those are:\n\n\nseat-code\n: This volume is seeded by the \nseat-app\n container and contains the actual SeAT source code. Any container that needs access to the SeAT sources (such as the app and worker containers) would mount this container to their respective, internal \n/var/www/seat\n directory.\n\n\nredis-data\n: This volume is used purely to let redis periodically backup the cache.\n\n\nmariadb-data\n: This is the \nmost important\n volume as it contains all of the database data. This is the one volume that you should configure a backup solution for!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix services (or containers) are used within the SeAT docker stack. Two of the services are pulled directly from \nDockerhub\n.\n    Four others are custom build and also hosted on DockerHub. Those containers are exposed in the table bellow :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Name\n\n\nImage Repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmariadb:10.3\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nredis:3\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/_/redis/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-nginx\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-nginx/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-app\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-app/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-worker\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-worker/\n\n\n\n\n\n\neveseat/eveseat-cron\n\n\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/eveseat/eveseat-cron/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment is configured using a top level \n.env\n file (not to be confused with the SeAT specific \n.env\n file (which should be transparent to a docker user anyways.))\n\n\nOnly two ports are exposed by default. Those are \ntcp/8080\n and \ntcp/8443\n. These can be connected to in order to access the SeAT web interface.\n\n\nAll containers are configured to restart on failure, so if your server reboots or a container dies for whatever reason it should automatically start up again.\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Docker Installation\n\u00b6\n\n\nDepending on wether you already have \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n already installed, you may choose how to start the installation. If you already have the required tooling installed and running their latest versions, all you need to do is download the latest \ndocker-compose.yml\n and \n.env\n files to get started.\n\n\nAutomated Setup Script\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have the required software installed yet, consider running the \nbootstrap script\n that will check for \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n, install it and start the SeAT stack up for you. The script can be run with:\n\n\nbash <\n(\ncurl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-docker\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the script is finished, you can skip to the \nmonitoring the stack\n section of this guide.\n\n\nIf you don't want to run this script, follow along in the next section of this guide.\n\n\nDocker Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have \ndocker\n, install it now with the following command as \nroot\n:\n\n\n# Installs docker\n\nsh <\n(\ncurl -fsSL get.docker.com\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker-compose Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you do not have \ndocker-compose\n, install it now with the following command as \nroot\n:\n\n\n# Downloads docker-compose\n\ncurl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.0/docker-compose-\n$(\nuname -s\n)\n-\n$(\nuname -m\n)\n -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\n# Makes docker-compose executable\n\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker compose working directory\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith \ndocker\n and \ndocker-compose\n ready, create yourself a directory in \n/opt\n with \nmkdir -p /opt/seat-docker\n and \ncd\n to it. Remember this directory as you will need to come back to it often.\n\n\nSeAT Docker-compose.yml and .env File\n\u00b6\n\n\nThen, download the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file with:\n\n\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/scripts/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, download the docker \n.env\n file with:\n\n\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eveseat/scripts/master/docker-compose/.env -o .env \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe location of the \ndocker-compose.yml\n and \n.env\n files are important. You need to \ncd\n back to the directory where these are stored in order to be able to execute commands for this stack at a later stage.\n\n\n\n\nWith the configuration files ready, start up the stack with:\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\n\nYep. Thats all you need to do :)\n\n\nMonitoring the Stack\n\u00b6\n\n\nKnowing what is going on inside of your containers is crucial to understanding how everything is running as well as useful when debugging any problems that may occur. While the containers are starting up or have been running for a while, you can always \ncd\n to the directory where your \ndocker-compose.yml\n file lives and run the \nlogs\n command to see the output of all of the containers in the stack. For example:\n\n\ncd\n /opt/seat-docker\ndocker-compose logs --tail \n10\n -f\n\n\n\n\n\nThese commands will \ncd\n to the directory containing the stacks \ndocker-compose.yml\n file and run the \nlogs\n command, showing the last \n10\n log entries and then printing new ones as they arrive.\n\n\nConfiguration Changes\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll of the relevant configuration lives inside the \n.env\n file, next to your \ndocker-compose.yml\n file. Modify its values by opening it in a text editor, making the appropriate changes and saving it again. Once that is done, run \ndocker-compose up -d\n again to restart the container environment.\n\n\nIf you followed along until now with the docker installation, the next step would be to login as an administrator and to configure SSO. #WIP#",

            "text": "Ubuntu\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis guide attempts to explain how to manually install SeAT onto an \nUbuntu\n Server.\nA small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, all though it is not entirely mandatory. This guide assumes you want all of the available SeAT components installed (which is the default).\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe are going to assume you have root access to a fresh Ubuntu Server. Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \naptitude\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\nEve Application\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT 3.0 consumes ESI in order to retrieve information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI, you have to create an \neve application\n. To do so, browse to https://developers.eveonline.com and login using the button on top right corner. Once done, on the top menu, click on \napplications\n then create a new one with \ncreate new application\n button.\n\n\nFill the initial form with whatever you want (\nname\n and \ndescription\n) but keep in mind that this information will be showed to the user while they sign in as well as when they review third party applications that have access to their account information.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nConnection Type\n section, check \nAuthentication & API Access\n and add scopes from which you want information. (you need only those starting by \nesi\n).\n\n\nIn the \nCallback URL\n section, put \nhttps://yourserver/auth/eve/callback\n where \nyourserver\n is either a domain or an IP pointing to the server where SeAT will be installed.\n\n\nFinally, click on \nCreate application\n button, back to \napplications\n and near the created application, hit the \nview application\n button.\n\n\n\n\nTake note of the \nClient ID\n, \nSecret Key\n, \nCallback URL\n fields which will be required at a later stage in this documentation.\n\n\nBasics\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will ensuring that your system is up to date before starting with package installation. So, let's start with basics :\n\n\n\n\napt-get update\n to refresh the repositories cache.\n\n\napt-get full-upgrade\n to update any installed packages.\n\n\nreboot\n in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version.\n\n\napt-get autoremove\n (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.\n\n\nThis document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.\n\n\ncurl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash\n this script provided by MariaDB team will setup your repositories properly\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nAt the time when this document was written, MariaDB as not available on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic.\nThe package version available in main repository does not meet minimum requirement as SeAT 3.0 requires at least version 10.2.7 or higher whereas official repository only provides 10.1.29. In order to install SeAT, use MySQL instead.\n\n\n\n\nLets install the database server:\n\n\napt-get install mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords. They are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nEnter current password \nfor\n root \n(\nenter \nfor\n none\n)\n:  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nSet root password? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove \ntest\n database and access to it? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the MySQL client by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\n\n\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\nmysql>\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run the command to create the SeAT database:\n\n\ncreate database seat\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> create database seat\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n1\n row affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n0\n rows affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as \nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\nFinally, we will reload sql server permission cache\n\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT is a PHP application, we will to install php packages. For now, we're relying on PHP 7.1 due to issues with Laravel on PHP 7.2 on some methods. We will add ondrej PPA which is very popular and caters for most php versions.\n\n\nLet's start by using an editor to create the file \n/etc/apt/source.list.d/php.list\n (\nnano\n or \nvi\n works well for such things).\nInside the newly created file, simply paste the block bellow :\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nXenial 16.04\n\n  \nArtful 17.10\n\n  \nBionic 18.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu xenial main\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu artful main\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu bionic main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will have to download the repository GPG key and add it into our keychain\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 4F4EA0AAE5267A6C\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate our repository cache\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, install php packages with SeAT dependencies\n\n\napt-get install curl zip php7.1-cli php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-intl php7.1-curl php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring php7.1-bz2 php7.1-dom php7.1-zip\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue back end. Installing it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\napt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere we go, all requirements are now met. We will start installing SeAT. Start with \ngit\n and \ncomposer\n which will handle our php package dependencies and download SeAT from our repositories.\n\n\napt-get install git\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer \n|\n php -- --install-dir\n=\n/usr/local/bin --filename\n=\ncomposer \n&&\n \nhash\n -r\n\n\n\n\n\nMove firstly to your \nwww\n directory with \ncd /var/www\n (in case it does not exists, create it using \nmkdir /var/www\n) and download SeAT using \ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev --stability=beta\n.\n\n\nNext, we will add a dedicated user for security reasons and in order to distinguish SeAT processes easier.\n\n\nadduser --group --no-create-home --system --disabled-login seat\nchown seat:seat -R /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nFix read and write access to storage directory which will store backups, logs, caches etc.\n\n\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we will edit SeAT main configuration file \n.env\n. This file will be located at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n\n\nUpdate it with the information you got earlier in the installation process. Refer to the table bellow in order to get each parameter description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Name\n\n\nDefault value\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPP_URL\n\n\nhttp://seat.local\n\n\nThis is the public address where SeAT instance is reachable. That should match with the \nEVE_CALLBACK_URL\n without \n/auth/eve/callback\n suffix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB_HOST\n\n\n127.0.0.1\n\n\nThis is the IP or domain from your SQL Server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB_PORT\n\n\n3306\n\n\nThis is the port used by your SQL Server to receive query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB_DATABASE\n\n\nseat\n\n\nThis is the name for your SeAT database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB_USERNAME\n\n\nseat\n\n\nThis is the user which is granted to the SeAT database from SeAT server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD\n\n\nsecret\n\n\nThis is the user password\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAIL_DRIVER\n\n\nsmtp\n\n\nThis is the driver used to send mail.

You should have only to fix \nseat.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will publish assets and seed the SeAT database. Let's do this with the following commands :\n\n\n\n\nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all'\n this will publish all package assets, including horizon\n\n\nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate'\n it will generate SeAT database structure\n\n\nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder'\n this will seed the scheduling table used for jobs\n\n\nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde'\n it will download latest SDE data\n\n\n\n\nSupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies on supervisor in order to keep the Horizon process up. Horizon is the new queue backend in SeAT 3.0.\n\n\napt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon. Use your favorite editor in order to spawn the file at the following path \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf\n\n\nInside the newly created file, add the following configuration items:\n\n\n[\nprogram:seat\n]\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon\n\nprocess_name\n \n=\n %\n(\nprogram_name\n)\ns-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d\n\nstdout_logfile\n \n=\n /var/log/seat-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d.log\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes\n=\n100MB\n\nstdout_logfile_backups\n=\n10\n\n\nnumprocs\n=\n1\n\n\ndirectory\n=\n/var/www/seat\n\nstopwaitsecs\n=\n600\n\n\nuser\n=\nseat\n\n\n\n\n\nReload supervisor using the following command :\n\n\nservice supervisor restart\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, setup crontab for SeAT with :\n\n\ncrontab -u seat -e\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd seed the tab with the following :\n\n\n* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly encourage you to use nginx and will be covered in this document. You don't \nhave\n to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly encourage you to use \nnginx\n or \ntraefik\n and these we will covered in the next few pages. You don't have to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nNginx\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's install nginx :\n\n\napt-get install nginx php7.1-fpm\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate the standard www pool configuration file from PHP-Fpm to a dedicated SeAT pool :\n\n\ncp /etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf /etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/seat.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, update the newly created pool file at \n/etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/seat.conf\n with some adequate values :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitial value\n\n\nnew value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[www]\n\n\n[seat]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser = www-data\n\n\nuser = seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup = www-data\n\n\ngroup = seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlisten = /run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock\n\n\nlisten = /run/php/seat.sock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, you can create a new configuration file into nginx to server SeAT called \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n\n\nAnd put the content bellow inside\n\n\nserver \n{\n\n    listen \n80\n;\n\n    listen \n[\n::\n]\n:80\n;\n\n\n    root /var/www/seat/public\n;\n\n\n    index index.htm index.html index.php\n;\n\n\n    location / \n{\n\n       try_files \n$uri\n \n$uri\n/ /index.php?\n$query_string\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    location ~ \n\\.\nphp$ \n{\n\n       try_files \n$uri\n \n=\n404\n;\n\n       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/seat.sock\n;\n\n       fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \n$document_root$fastcgi_script_name\n;\n\n       include fastcgi_params\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    location ~ /\n\\.\nht \n{\n\n       deny all\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's symlink to the active config and drop the default one :\n\n\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat\nrm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload services :\n\n\nservice php7.1-fpm reload\nservice nginx reload\n\n\n\n\n\nApache\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has.

It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.  curl -sS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash  this script provided by MariaDB team will setup your repositories properly   Warning  At the time when this document was written, MariaDB as not available on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic.\nThe package version available in main repository does not meet minimum requirement as SeAT 3.0 requires at least version 10.2.7 or higher whereas official repository only provides 10.1.29. In order to install SeAT, use MySQL instead.   Lets install the database server:  apt-get install mariadb-server  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password.   Note  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:  [ ... ] \n\nEnter current password  for  root  ( enter  for  none ) :  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] \n\nSet root password?  [ Y/n ]  y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!

[ Y/n ]  y [ ... ] \n\nReload privilege tables now?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.  Fire up the MySQL client by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)  If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  [ ... ] \nmysql>  Lets run the command to create the SeAT database:  create database seat ;   The output should be similar to the below:  mysql> create database seat ; \nQuery OK,  1  row affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   Next, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the  seat  database:  GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ;   Of course, you need to replace  s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd  with your own.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:  mysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; \nQuery OK,  0  rows affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as  seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .\nFinally, we will reload sql server permission cache  FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;    Note  Remember the password for the  seat  database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.",

Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? [Y/n] y\n\n \n... Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y\n\n \n... Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nRemove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y\n\n \n... Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the MySQL client by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nmysql>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run the command to create the SeAT database:\n\n\ncreate database seat;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> create database seat;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as \nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Remember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nphp & apache\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT is written in PHP, and therefore we need to install the PHP interpreter. We also need to install a web server that will allow us to server the web front end that comes with SeAT.\n\n\nSo, install the required packages with:\n\n\nyum install -y httpd php php-mysql php-cli php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring php-intl php-dom php-gd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be asked if you want to accept some GPG keys for package verification here. Just say [Y]. Successful installation should end with something like the below:\n\n\nInstalled\n:\n\n  \nhttpd\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n2.2\n.\n15\n-\n47\n.\nel6\n.\ncentos\n          \nphp\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n             \nphp\n-\ncli\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n          \nphp\n-\nintl\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n\n  \nphp\n-\nmbstring\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n      \nphp\n-\nmcrypt\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n      \nphp\n-\nmysqlnd\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n      \nphp\n-\nprocess\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n\n\n\nDependency\n \nInstalled\n:\n\n  \napr\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.3\n.\n9\n-\n5\n.\nel6_2\n                    \napr\n-\nutil\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.3\n.\n9\n-\n3\n.\nel6_0\n.\n1\n       \napr\n-\nutil\n-\nldap\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.3\n.\n9\n-\n3\n.\nel6_0\n.\n1\n   \nhttpd\n-\ntools\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n2.2\n.\n15\n-\n47\n.\nel6\n.\ncentos\n\n  \nlibicu\n-\nlast\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n50.1\n.\n2\n-\n11\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n       \nlibmcrypt\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n2.5\n.\n8\n-\n9\n.\nel6\n          \nlibtool\n-\nltdl\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n2.2\n.\n6\n-\n15.5\n.\nel6\n     \nlibzip\n-\nlast\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.0\n.\n1\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n\n  \nmailcap\n.\nnoarch\n \n0\n:\n2.1\n.\n31\n-\n2\n.\nel6\n                 \nphp\n-\ncommon\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n   \nphp\n-\npdo\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n5.5\n.\n30\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n       \nphp\n-\npecl\n-\njsonc\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.3\n.\n9\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n.\n5.5\n\n  \nphp\n-\npecl\n-\nzip\n.\nx86_64\n \n0\n:\n1.13\n.\n1\n-\n1\n.\nel6\n.\nremi\n.\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can start apache and configure it automatically start the next time the server boots up:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/httpd start\n\n\n\n\n\nchkconfig httpd on\n\n\n\n\n\nredis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue backend. Installing it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\nyum install -y redis\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, start it and configure it to autostart next time the server boots up:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/redis start\n\n\n\n\n\nchkconfig redis on\n\n\n\n\n\ncomposer and git\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of the de-facto PHP dependency manager called \nComposer\n. Composer is required to both install and update SeAT at a later stage. It is for this reason that it is recommended that you install composer globally on your server so that you can access it by simply typing \ncomposer\n. Lets set that up by downloading Composer and saving it to \n/usr/local/bin\n:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer && hash -r\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful installation should output something like:\n\n\n[root@seat ~]# curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer && hash -r\n#!/usr/bin/env php\nAll settings correct for using Composer\nDownloading...\n\nComposer successfully installed to: /usr/local/bin/composer\nUse it: php /usr/local/bin/composer\n\n\n\n\n\nAs all of the source code is hosted on Github which is a Git based source control system, we need to install \ngit\n itself. Do this with:\n\n\nyum install git -y\n\n\n\n\n\nseat download\n\u00b6\n\n\nFinally, we get to install SeAT itself. The first thing we need to do is to decide where to save SeAT itself. This directory should have enough space for the cached XML files to live on, as well as a few log files should you need to debug problems. The recommended location is \n/var/www/seat/\n. To save SeAT in this directory, first change to it:\n\n\ncd /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will download SeAT using \ncomposer\n and save it to the \nseat\n directory.\n\nNOTE\n This can take some time, Composer does a ton of magic here :+1: (like recursively resolving all dependencies :O)\n\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful installation should end with something like:\n\n\nWriting lock file\nGenerating autoload files\n> Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate\n> php artisan optimize\nGenerating optimized class loader\nCompiling common classes\n> php artisan key:generate\nApplication key [base64:WFfzkuIpUGpkDNu0SRtwhPphpM66UvzuZpEML/6dEVQ=] set successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nseat permissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT writes logfiles/cachefiles and other temporary data to the \nseat/storage/\n directory. That together with the fact that the web content will be hosted by apache means that we need to configure the files permissions to allow SeAT do do its thing.\n\n\nFirst, lets ensure that \napache\n owns everything in /var/www/seat which is the folder we just downloaded SeAT to:\n\n\nchown -R apache:apache /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will allow Apache to write to the \nseat/storage/\n directory so that it may manipulate the files in there as needed:\n\n\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT is now downloaded and almost ready for use!\n\n\nselinux\n\u00b6\n\n\nMany people hate SELinux, primarily due to a misunderstanding of what it does and how it works. SeAT can run perfectly fine with SELinux enabled, and I actually encourage you to leave it enabled. There is however one small settings change required to make everything work as expected.\n\n\nFirst, we have to allow apache to make network connections. This is so that we may connect to the EVEAPI, as well as the MySQL database and Redis. We also have to allow Apache to write to disk. So, configure this with:\n\n\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_unified 1\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to ensure that the files and folders in \n/var/www/seat\n is correctly labelled in order to prevent SELinux from blocking perfectly normal behaviour. Check this with:\n\n\nrestorecon -Rv /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it. Pretty painless eh? :)\n\n\nseat setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we need to configure SeAT to know where the database server lives. Do this by editing \n/var/www/seat/.env\n and setting the appropriate values:\n\n\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_PORT=3306\nDB_DATABASE=seat\nDB_USERNAME=seat\nDB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\nDB_DEBUG=false\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on, we should publish the internal databse migrations, css & javasript, and other goodies with:\n\n\nphp artisan vendor:publish --force\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, run the database migrations to get the SeAT database ready for use:\n\n\nphp artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to run the seeders to populate som default data for SeAT to use:\n\n\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Notifications\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\NotificationTypesSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the latest static data export must be downloaded and imported with:\n\n\nphp artisan eve:update:sde -n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the SeAT admin user needs to have a password set. There is no default SeAT admin password.\n\n\nphp artisan seat:admin:reset\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing, an email address is needed for the admin user too.\n\n\nphp artisan seat:admin:email\n\n\n\n\n\nsupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of workers to actually process the update jobs that get scheduled. Think if the architecture as someone coming and dumping mail at the postoffice, and its up to say 4 workers to dig through the mail and sort it. Those 4 workers need a manager to ensure that they keep working. \nsupervisord\n is a excellent candidate for the manager job.\n\n\nLets install supervisor, start it and configure it to start automatically the next time the server boots:\n\n\nyum install supervisor -y\n\n\n\n\n\n/etc/init.d/supervisord start\n\n\n\n\n\nchkconfig supervisord on\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have to configure the actual workers that supervisord will manage. We do this by adding a new configuration file to \n/etc/supervisord.d/\n called \nseat.ini\n Note that the number of workers that we want to start is set by the \nnumprocs\n settings:\n\n\n[program:seat]\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --tries 1 --timeout=86100\n\n\nprocess_name\n \n=\n \n%(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d\n\n\nstdout_logfile\n \n=\n \n/var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log\n\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes\n=\n100MB\n\n\nstdout_logfile_backups\n=\n10\n\n\nnumprocs\n=\n4\n\n\ndirectory\n=\n/var/www/seat\n\n\nstopwaitsecs\n=\n600\n\n\nuser\n=\napache\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your file and reload \nsupervisord\n so that it is aware of the changes that we have made:\n\n\n/etc/init.d/supervisord restart\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, check that everything is OK and the workers have started up:\n\n\n[root@seat seat]# supervisorctl status\nseat:seat-8000                   RUNNING    pid 5083, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8001                   RUNNING    pid 5082, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8002                   RUNNING    pid 5085, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8003                   RUNNING    pid 5084, uptime 0:00:28\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have output such as in the above block, check the log files for any possible errors.\n\n\ncrontab\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have SeAT workers running meaning that it is ready to process jobs that enter the Queue. We now need a way to add jobs to that Queue for processing by the workers.\nSeAT has a build in schedule for when what should run at which interval. With the cronjob, we are simply telling SeAT to check every minute \"is there anything we should be doing?\". We will add the cronjob as the \napache\n user as this is the user that has had all its \npermissions\n configured earlier.\n\n\nOpen up the crontab for \napache\n with:\n\n\ncrontab -u apache -e\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, paste the following line at the bottom of the file (remember to check the path if you chose one other that the one in this guide):\n\n\n* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\n\n\n\nwebserver - apache\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to get the SeAT fronted running, we need to configure Apache to serve our SeAT installs \npublic/\n folder. This is the only folder that should be internet facing. That small \nindex.php\n is the gateway into the application.\nThe Apache configuration itself will depend on how your server is set up. Generally, virtual hosting is the way to go, and this is what I will be showing here.\n\n\nIf you are not going to use virtual hosting, the easiest to get going will probably to symlink \n/var/www/seat/public/\n to \n/var/www/html/seat\n and configuring apache to \nAllowOverride All\n in the \n<Directory \"/var/www/html\">\n section. This should have SeAT available at http://your-host-name-or-ip/seat after you restart apache.\n\n\nvirtual host setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nGetting the virtual host setup is as simple as creating a new configuration file (I usually call it the \nsites-domain.conf\n), and modifying it to match your setup. Everywhere you see \nseat.local\n as the hostname in the below examples it needs to be substituted to your actual domain.\n\n\nLets prepare some directories. We create the directory \n/var/www/html/seat.local\n with:\n\n\nmkdir /var/www/html/seat.local\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we symlink the SeAT public directory there with:\n\n\nln -s /var/www/seat/public /var/www/html/seat.local/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to configure Apache itself to know about the directories and stuff SeAT needs. We need to create that \nsites-domain.conf\n file I mentioned. This file should live in \n/etc/httpd/conf.d\n, so lets change directories there:\n\n\ncd /etc/httpd/conf.d\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, create the conf file. In my case, the domain is \nseat.local\n, so I will call it \nseat.local.conf\n. Add the following contents to that file:\n\n\n<VirtualHost\n \n*:80\n>\n\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@your.domain\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/seat.local\"\n    ServerName seat.local\n    ServerAlias www.seat.local\n    ErrorLog \"logs/seat.local-error_log\"\n    CustomLog \"logs/seat.local-access_log\" common\n    \n<Directory\n \n\"/var/www/html/seat.local\"\n>\n\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    \n</Directory>\n\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our config file created, we need to restart apache to read the new file:\n\n\napachectl restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThat should be it from a configuration perspective. We can confirm that everything is configured correctly by running:\n\n\n[root@seat conf.d]# apachectl -t -D DUMP_VHOSTS\nhttpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using seat.localdomain for ServerName\nVirtualHost configuration:\nwildcard NameVirtualHosts and _default_ servers:\n*:80                   seat.local (/etc/httpd/conf.d/seat.local.conf:1)\nSyntax OK\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it! SeAT should now be available at http://your-domain-or-ip/seat",

Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users etc. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  Lets install the database server first:  yum install mysql mysql-server -y  With the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time out server boots up:  /etc/init.d/mysqld start  chkconfig mysqld on  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password.   NOTE  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:  [...]  Enter current password for root (enter for none):  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER  OK, successfully used password, moving on...  [...]  Set root password? [Y/n] y  New password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE  Re-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE  Password updated successfully!

Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.  Fire up the MySQL client by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  [...]  mysql>   Lets run the command to create the SeAT database:  create database seat;  The output should be similar to the below:  mysql> create database seat;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)  Next, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the  seat  database:  GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';  Of course, you need to replace  s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd  with your own. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:  mysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)  In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as  seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .   NOTE  Remember the password for the  seat  database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.",

Typically access is gained via SSH. All of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT. If the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too (such as hosting MariaDB databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \nyum\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\ntable of contents\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nRepositories\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nPHP & Apache\n\n\nRedis\n\n\nComposer and Git\n\n\nSeAT - Download\n\n\nSeAT - Permissions\n\n\nSELinux\n\n\nSeAT - Setup\n\n\nSupervisor\n\n\nCrontab\n\n\nWebserver - Apache\n\n   i. \nVirtual Host Setup\n\n\n\n\nrepositories\n\u00b6\n\n\nDue to the nature of CentOS 7.x packaging and the limitations in getting 'bleeding edge' software with it, we need to add some extra software repositories in order to get SeAT running. These repositories are known as the \nFedora EPEL\n and \nRemi\n repositories. Adding these repositories will allow us to get access to PHP 7 which is a requirement for SeAT.\n\n\nTo install / configure the required repositories, run the following commands:\n\n\nepel\n\u00b6\n\n\n# Download and install Epel\n\n\nEPEL\n=\nepel\n-\nrelease\n-\nlatest\n-\n7.\nnoarch\n.\nrpm\n \n&&\n \ncurl\n \n-\nO\n \nhttps\n:\n//\ndl\n.\nfedoraproject\n.\norg\n/\npub\n/\nepel\n/\n$\nEPEL\n \n&&\n \nyum\n \nlocalinstall\n \n-\ny\n \n$\nEPEL\n \n&&\n \nrm\n \n-\nf\n \n$\nEPEL\n\n\n\n# Import signing key\n\n\nrpm\n \n--\nimport\n \n\"http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremi\n\u00b6\n\n\n# Download and install Epel\n\n\nREMI\n=\nremi\n-\nrelease\n-\n7.\nrpm\n \n&&\n \ncurl\n \n-\nO\n \nhttp\n:\n//\nrpms\n.\nremirepo\n.\nnet\n/\nenterprise\n/\n$\nREMI\n \n&&\n \nyum\n \nlocalinstall\n \n-\ny\n \n$\nREMI\n \n&&\n \nrm\n \n-\nf\n \n$\nREMI\n\n\n\n# Import signing key\n\n\nrpm\n \n--\nimport\n \nhttp\n:\n//\nrpms\n.\nremirepo\n.\nnet\n/\nRPM\n-\nGPG\n-\nKEY\n-\nremi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will quickly install \nyum-utils\n and enable the \nremi-php70\n repository in order to gain access to PHP 7.0.\n\n\nyum install yum-utils -y\n\n\n\n\n\nyum-config-manager --enable remi,remi-php70\n\n\n\n\n\ndatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function. Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users etc. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.\n\n\nLets install the database server first:\n\n\nyum install -y mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see output similar to the following:\n\n\n[... snip ...]\n\n\nInstalled:\n\n  \nmariadb-server.x86_64 1:5.5.44-1.el7_1\n\n\n[... snip ...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time out server boots up:\n\n\nsystemctl enable mariadb.service\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, start the DB server with\n\n\nsystemctl start mariadb.service\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n The database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords. They are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nEnter current password for root (enter for none):  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\n\n\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nSet root password? [Y/n] y\n\n\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\n\n\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\n\n\nPassword updated successfully!\n\n\nReloading privilege tables..\n\n \n... Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? [Y/n] y\n\n \n... Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y\n\n \n...

Success!\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.\n\n\nFire up the MySQL client by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n. This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\n[...]\n\n\nMariaDB [(none)]>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run the command to create the SeAT database:\n\n\ncreate database seat;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB [(none)]> create database seat;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nMariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as \nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n Remember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nphp & apache\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT is written in PHP, and therefore we need to install the PHP interpreter. We also need to install a web server that will allow us to server the web front end that comes with SeAT.\n\n\nSo, install the required packages with:\n\n\nyum install -y httpd php php-mysql php-cli php-mcrypt php-process php-mbstring php-intl php-dom php-gd\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may be asked if you want to accept some GPG keys for package verification here. Just say [Y].\n\n\nNext, we can start apache and configure it automatically start the next time the server boots up:\n\n\nsystemctl enable httpd.service\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we start Apache\n\n\nsystemctl start httpd.service\n\n\n\n\n\nredis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue backend.

It is for this reason that it is recommended that you install composer globally on your server so that you can access it by simply typing \ncomposer\n. Lets set that up by downloading Composer and saving it to \n/usr/local/bin\n:\n\n\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer && hash -r\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful installation should output something like:\n\n\n[root@seat ~]# curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer && hash -r\n#!/usr/bin/env php\nAll settings correct for using Composer\nDownloading...\n\nComposer successfully installed to: /usr/local/bin/composer\nUse it: php /usr/local/bin/composer\n\n\n\n\n\nAs all of the source code is hosted on Github which is a Git based source control system, we need to install \ngit\n itself.

This directory should have enough space for the cached XML files to live on, as well as a few log files should you need to debug problems. The recommended location is \n/var/www/seat/\n. To save SeAT in this directory, first change to it:\n\n\ncd /var/www\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will download SeAT using \ncomposer\n and save it to the \nseat\n directory.\n\nNOTE\n This can take some time, Composer does a ton of magic here :+1: (like recursively resolving all dependencies :O)\n\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful installation should end with something like:\n\n\nWriting lock file\nGenerating autoload files\n> Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate\n> php artisan optimize\nGenerating optimized class loader\nCompiling common classes\n> php artisan key:generate\nApplication key [base64:WFfzkuIpUGpkDNu0SRtwhPphpM66UvzuZpEML/6dEVQ=] set successfully.\n\n\n\n\n\nseat permissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT writes logfiles/cachefiles and other temporary data to the \nseat/storage/\n directory. That together with the fact that the web content will be hosted by apache means that we need to configure the files permissions to allow SeAT do do its thing.\n\n\nFirst, lets ensure that \napache\n owns everything in /var/www/seat which is the folder we just downloaded SeAT to:\n\n\nchown -R apache:apache /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will allow Apache to write to the \nseat/storage/\n directory so that it may manipulate the files in there as needed:\n\n\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage/\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT is now downloaded and almost ready for use!\n\n\nselinux\n\u00b6\n\n\nMany people hate SELinux, primarily due to a misunderstanding of what it does and how it works. SeAT can run perfectly fine with SELinux enabled, and I actually encourage you to leave it enabled. There is however one small settings change required to make everything work as expected.\n\n\nFirst, we have to allow apache to make network connections. This is so that we may connect to the EVEAPI, as well as the MySQL database and Redis. We also have to allow Apache to write to disk. So, configure this with:\n\n\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_unified 1\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to ensure that the files and folders in \n/var/www/seat\n is correctly labelled in order to prevent SELinux from blocking perfectly normal behaviour. Check this with:\n\n\nrestorecon -Rv /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nThats it. Pretty painless eh? :)\n\n\nseat setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we need to configure SeAT to know where the database server lives. Do this by editing \n/var/www/seat/.env\n and setting the appropriate values:\n\n\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_PORT=3306\nDB_DATABASE=seat\nDB_USERNAME=seat\nDB_PASSWORD=s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\nDB_DEBUG=false\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving on, we should publish the internal databse migrations, css & javasript, and other goodies with:\n\n\nphp artisan vendor:publish --force\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, run the database migrations to get the SeAT database ready for use:\n\n\nphp artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we need to run the seeders to populate som default data for SeAT to use:\n\n\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Notifications\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\NotificationTypesSeeder\nphp artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the latest static data export must be downloaded and imported with:\n\n\nphp artisan eve:update:sde -n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the SeAT admin user needs to have a password set. There is no default SeAT admin password.\n\n\nphp artisan seat:admin:reset\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing, an email address is needed for the admin user too.\n\n\nphp artisan seat:admin:email\n\n\n\n\n\nsupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of workers to actually process the update jobs that get scheduled. Think if the architecture as someone coming and dumping mail at the postoffice, and its up to say 4 workers to dig through the mail and sort it. Those 4 workers need a manager to ensure that they keep working. \nsupervisord\n is a excellent candidate for the manager job.\n\n\nLets install supervisor, start it and configure it to start automatically the next time the server boots:\n\n\nyum install supervisor -y\n\n\n\n\n\nsystemctl enable supervisord.service\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have to configure the actual workers that supervisord will manage. We do this by adding a new configuration file to \n/etc/supervisord.d/\n called \nseat.ini\n Note that the number of workers that we want to start is set by the \nnumprocs\n settings:\n\n\n[program:seat]\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --tries 1 --timeout=86100\n\n\nprocess_name\n \n=\n \n%(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d\n\n\nstdout_logfile\n \n=\n \n/var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log\n\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes\n=\n100MB\n\n\nstdout_logfile_backups\n=\n10\n\n\nnumprocs\n=\n4\n\n\ndirectory\n=\n/var/www/seat\n\n\nstopwaitsecs\n=\n600\n\n\nuser\n=\napache\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your file and start \nsupervisord\n so that it is aware of the changes that we have made:\n\n\nsystemctl start supervisord.service\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, check that everything is OK and the workers have started up:\n\n\n[root@seat seat]# supervisorctl status\nseat:seat-8000                   RUNNING    pid 5083, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8001                   RUNNING    pid 5082, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8002                   RUNNING    pid 5085, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8003                   RUNNING    pid 5084, uptime 0:00:28\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have output such as in the above block, check the log files for any possible errors.\n\n\ncrontab\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo far, we have SeAT workers running meaning that it is ready to process jobs that enter the Queue. We now need a way to add jobs to that Queue for processing by the workers.\nSeAT has a build in schedule for when what should run at which interval. With the cronjob, we are simply telling SeAT to check every minute \"is there anything we should be doing?\". We will add the cronjob as the \napache\n user as this is the user that has had all its \npermissions\n configured earlier.\n\n\nOpen up the crontab for \napache\n with:\n\n\ncrontab -u apache -e\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, paste the following line at the bottom of the file (remember to check the path if you chose one other that the one in this guide):\n\n\n* * * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\n\n\n\nwebserver - apache\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to get the SeAT fronted running, we need to configure Apache to serve our SeAT installs \npublic/\n folder. This is the only folder that should be internet facing. That small \nindex.php\n is the gateway into the application.\nThe Apache configuration itself will depend on how your server is set up. Generally, virtual hosting is the way to go, and this is what I will be showing here.\n\n\nIf you are not going to use virtual hosting, the easiest to get going will probably to symlink \n/var/www/seat/public/\n to \n/var/www/html/seat\n and configuring apache to \nAllowOverride All\n in the \n<Directory \"/var/www/html\">\n section. This should have SeAT available at http://your-host-name-or-ip/seat after you restart apache.\n\n\nvirtual host setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nGetting the virtual host setup is as simple as creating a new configuration file (I usually call it the \nsites-domain.conf\n), and modifying it to match your setup. Everywhere you see \nseat.local\n as the hostname in the below examples it needs to be substituted to your actual domain.\n\n\nWe symlink the SeAT public directory with:\n\n\nln -s /var/www/seat/public /var/www/html/seat.local\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to configure Apache itself to know about the directories and stuff SeAT needs. We need to create that \nsites-domain.conf\n file I mentioned. This file should live in \n/etc/httpd/conf.d\n, so lets change directories there:\n\n\ncd /etc/httpd/conf.d\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, create the conf file. In my case, the domain is \nseat.local\n, so I will call it \nseat.local.conf\n. Add the following contents to that file:\n\n\n<VirtualHost\n \n*:80\n>\n\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@your.domain\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/seat.local\"\n    ServerName seat.local\n    ServerAlias www.seat.local\n    ErrorLog \"logs/seat.local-error_log\"\n    CustomLog \"logs/seat.local-access_log\" common\n    \n<Directory\n \n\"/var/www/html/seat.local\"\n>\n\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    \n</Directory>\n\n\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our config file created, we need to restart apache to read the new file:\n\n\napachectl restart\n\n\n\n\n\nThat should be it from a configuration perspective. We can confirm that everything is configured correctly by running:\n\n\nThats it! SeAT should now be available at http://your-domain-or-ip/",

Everything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users etc. It comes without saying that database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your installation where required.  Lets install the database server first:  yum install -y mariadb-server  You should see output similar to the following:  [... snip ...]  Installed: \n   mariadb-server.x86_64 1:5.5.44-1.el7_1  [... snip ...]   With the database server installed, lets start it and configure it to automatically start up the next time out server boots up:  systemctl enable mariadb.service  Next, start the DB server with  systemctl start mariadb.service  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password.   NOTE  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords. They are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:  [...]  Enter current password for root (enter for none):  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER  OK, successfully used password, moving on...  [...]  Set root password? [Y/n] y  New password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE  Re-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE  Password updated successfully!  Reloading privilege tables.. \n  ... Success!  [...]  Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y \n  ... Success!  [...]  Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y \n  ... Success!  [...]  Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y  [...]  Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y \n  ... Success!  [...]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it. Next, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server. For that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user that will be accessing it. Let get to it.  Fire up the MySQL client by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password. Use the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation . This will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :) If the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  [...]  MariaDB [(none)]>   Lets run the command to create the SeAT database:  create database seat;  The output should be similar to the below:  MariaDB [(none)]> create database seat;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)  Next, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the  seat  database:  GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';  Of course, you need to replace  s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd  with your own. Successfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:  MariaDB [(none)]> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)  In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as  seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .

We do this by adding a new configuration file to  /etc/supervisord.d/  called  seat.ini  Note that the number of workers that we want to start is set by the  numprocs  settings:  [program:seat]  command = /usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan queue:work --queue=high,medium,low,default --tries 1 --timeout=86100  process_name   =   %(program_name)s-80%(process_num)02d  stdout_logfile   =   /var/log/seat-80%(process_num)02d.log  stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 100MB  stdout_logfile_backups = 10  numprocs = 4  directory = /var/www/seat  stopwaitsecs = 600  user = apache   Save your file and start  supervisord  so that it is aware of the changes that we have made:  systemctl start supervisord.service  Lastly, check that everything is OK and the workers have started up:  [root@seat seat]# supervisorctl status\nseat:seat-8000                   RUNNING    pid 5083, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8001                   RUNNING    pid 5082, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8002                   RUNNING    pid 5085, uptime 0:00:28\nseat:seat-8003                   RUNNING    pid 5084, uptime 0:00:28  If you do not have output such as in the above block, check the log files for any possible errors.",

We symlink the SeAT public directory with:  ln -s /var/www/seat/public /var/www/html/seat.local  Next, we have to configure Apache itself to know about the directories and stuff SeAT needs. We need to create that  sites-domain.conf  file I mentioned. This file should live in  /etc/httpd/conf.d , so lets change directories there:  cd /etc/httpd/conf.d  Now, create the conf file. In my case, the domain is  seat.local , so I will call it  seat.local.conf . Add the following contents to that file:  <VirtualHost   *:80 > \n    ServerAdmin webmaster@your.domain\n    DocumentRoot \"/var/www/html/seat.local\"\n    ServerName seat.local\n    ServerAlias www.seat.local\n    ErrorLog \"logs/seat.local-error_log\"\n    CustomLog \"logs/seat.local-access_log\" common\n     <Directory   \"/var/www/html/seat.local\" > \n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n     </Directory>  </VirtualHost>   With our config file created, we need to restart apache to read the new file:  apachectl restart  That should be it from a configuration perspective.

            "text": "Debian\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis guide attempts to explain how to manually install SeAT onto an \nDebian\n Server.\nA small amount of Linux experience is preferred when it comes to this guide, all though it is not entirely mandatory.\nThis guide assumes you want all of the available SeAT components installed (which is the default).\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe are going to assume you have root access to a fresh Debian Server. Typically access is gained via SSH.\nAll of the below commands are to be entered in the SSH terminal session for the installation & configuration of SeAT.\nIf the server you want to install SeAT on is being used for other things too\n(such as hosting MySQL databases and or websites), then please keep that in mind while following this guide.\n\n\nPackages are installed using the \naptitude\n package manager as the \nroot\n user.\n\n\nEve Application\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT 3.0 consumes ESI in order to retrieve information. Before you can make any authenticated calls to ESI,\nyou have to create an \neve application\n. To do so, browse to https://developers.eveonline.com and login using\nthe button on top right corner. On the top menu, click on \napplications\n then create a new one\nwith \ncreate new application\n button.\n\n\nFill the initial form with whatever you want (\nname\n and \ndescription\n) but keep in mind that this information will be\nshown to the user while they sign in as well as when they review third party applications that have access to their\naccount information.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nConnection Type\n section, check \nAuthentication & API Access\n and add scopes from which you want information.\n  (you need only those starting by \nesi\n).\n\n\nIn the \nCallback URL\n section, put \nhttps://yourserver/auth/eve/callback\n where \nyourserver\n is either a domain or\n   an IP pointing to the server where SeAT will be installed.\n\n\nFinally, click on \nCreate application\n button, back to \napplications\n and near the created application,\n   hit the \nview application\n button.\n\n\n\n\nTake note of the \nClient ID\n, \nSecret Key\n, \nCallback URL\n fields which will be required at a later stage in\nthis documentation.\n\n\nBasics\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will ensure that your system is up to date before starting with package installations. So, let's start with some\nbasics :\n\n\n\n\napt-get update\n to refresh the repositories cache.\n\n\napt-get full-upgrade\n to update any installed packages.\n\n\nreboot\n in order to ensure any updated software is the current running version.\n\n\napt-get autoremove\n (after the reboot) to cleanup any unneeded packages.\n\n\napt-get install sudo apt-transport-https\n this will provide sudo and https support for packages repositories\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies \nheavily\n on a database to function.\nEverything it learns is stored here, along with things such as user accounts for your users. It comes without saying\nthat database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your\ninstallation where required.\n\n\nThis document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.\n\n\nLet's start by using an editor to create the file \n/etc/apt/source.list.d/mariadb.list\n (\nnano\n or \nvi\n works well for\nsuch things). Inside the newly created file, simply paste the block bellow :\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nStretch 9\n\n  \nJessie 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb http://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.2/repo/debian stretch main\n\n\nOnce done, we will add the GPG key from MariaDB repository into our keychain using\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb http://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.2/repo/debian jessie main\n\n\nOnce done, we will add the GPG key from MariaDB repository into our keychain using\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xCBCB082A1BB943DB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets install the database server:\n\n\napt-get install mariadb-server\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a \nroot\n password.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe database \nroot\n password should not be confused with the operating systems \nroot\n passwords.\nThey are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.\n\n\n\n\nTo secure the database, run:\n\n\nmysql_secure_installation\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nEnter current password \nfor\n root \n(\nenter \nfor\n none\n)\n:  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on...\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nSet root password? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove anonymous users? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nDisallow root login remotely? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nRemove \ntest\n database and access to it? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\nReload privilege tables now? \n[\nY/n\n]\n y\n ... Success!\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.\nNext, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server.\nFor that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user\nthat will be accessing it.\nLet get to it.\n\n\nFire up the MySQL client by running:\n\n\nmysql -uroot -p\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prompt you for a password.\nUse the password you configured for the \nroot\n account when we ran \nmysql_secure_installation\n.\nThis will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:\n\n\n[\n...\n]\n\nmysql>\n\n\n\n\n\nLets run the command to create the SeAT database:\n\n\ncreate database seat\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output should be similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> create database seat\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n1\n row affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the \nseat\n database:\n\n\nGRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you need to replace \ns_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd\n with your own.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:\n\n\nmysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY \n's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd'\n;\n\nQuery OK, \n0\n rows affected \n(\n0\n.00 sec\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as\n\nseat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat\n.\nFinally, we will reload sql server permission cache\n\n\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nRemember the password for the \nseat\n database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT is a PHP application, we will to install php packages.\nFor now, we're relying on PHP 7.1 due to issues with Laravel on PHP 7.2 on some methods.\nWe will add ondrej DPA which is very popular and caters for most php versions.\n\n\nLet's start by using an editor to create the file \n/etc/apt/source.list.d/php.list\n.\nInside the newly created file, simply paste the block bellow :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretch 9\n\n\nJessie 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\ndeb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ stretch main\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeb https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\ndeb-src https://packages.sury.org/php/ jessie main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will have to download the repository GPG key and add it into our keychain\n\n\napt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com AC0E47584A7A714D\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate our repository cache\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, install PHP packages needed as SeAT dependencies\n\n\napt-get install curl zip php7.1-cli php7.1-mysql php7.1-mcrypt php7.1-intl php7.1-curl php7.1-gd php7.1-mbstring\nphp7.1-bz2 php7.1-dom php7.1-zip\n\n\n\n\n\nRedis\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT makes use of \nRedis\n as a cache and message broker for the Queue backend.\nInstalling it is really easy. Do it with:\n\n\napt-get install redis-server\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Download\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere we go, all requirements are now met. We will start installing SeAT itself.\nStart with \ngit\n and \ncomposer\n which will handle our php package dependencies and download SeAT from our repositories.\n\n\napt-get install git\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer \n|\n php -- --install-dir\n=\n/usr/local/bin --filename\n=\ncomposer \n&&\n \nhash\n -r\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the www directory using \nmkdir /var/www\n, then move into it with \ncd /var/www\n and download SeAT using\n\ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat --no-dev --stability=beta\n.\n\n\nNext, we will add a dedicated user for security reasons and in to help us distinguish SeAT processes easier.\n\n\nadduser --group --no-create-home --system --disabled-login seat\nchown seat:seat -R /var/www/seat\n\n\n\n\n\nFix read and write access to storage directory which will store backups, logs, caches etc.\n\n\nchmod -R guo+w /var/www/seat/storage\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we will edit SeAT main configuration file \n.env\n. This file will be located at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n\n\nUpdate it with the information you got earlier in the installation process. Refer to the table bellow in order to get\na description of each parameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Name\n\n\nDefault value\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPP_URL\n\n\nhttp://seat.local\n\n\nThis is the public address where your SeAT instance will be reachable.

You should have only to update the \nseat.local\n component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will publish assets and seed the SeAT database. Let's do this with the following commands :\n - \nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan vendor:publish --force --all'\n this will publish all package assets, including horizon\n - \nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan migrate'\n it will generate SeAT database structure\n - \nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan db:seed --class=Seat\\\\Services\\\\database\\\\seeds\\\\ScheduleSeeder'\n this will seed the scheduling table used for jobs\n - \nsudo -H -u seat bash -c 'php /var/www/seat/artisan eve:update:sde'\n it will download latest SDE data\n\n\nSupervisor\n\u00b6\n\n\nSeAT relies on supervisor in order to keep the Horizon process up. Horizon is the new queue backend in SeAT 3.0.\n\n\napt-get install supervisor\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will create a dedicated configuration file which will ask supervisor to keep an eye on Horizon.\nLet's start by using an editor to create the file \n/etc/supervisor/conf.d/seat.conf\n.\n\n\nInside the newly created file, add the following configuration items:\n\n\n[\nprogram:seat\n]\n\n\ncommand\n=\n/usr/bin/php /var/www/seat/artisan horizon\n\nprocess_name\n \n=\n %\n(\nprogram_name\n)\ns-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d\n\nstdout_logfile\n \n=\n /var/log/seat-80%\n(\nprocess_num\n)\n02d.log\n\nstdout_logfile_maxbytes\n=\n100MB\n\nstdout_logfile_backups\n=\n10\n\n\nnumprocs\n=\n1\n\n\ndirectory\n=\n/var/www/seat\n\nstopwaitsecs\n=\n600\n\n\nuser\n=\nseat\n\n\n\n\n\nReload supervisor using the following command :\n\n\nservice supervisor restart\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, setup crontab for SeAT with :\n\n\ncrontab -u seat -e\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd seed the tab with the following :\n\n\n* * * * * php /var/www/seat/artisan schedule:run\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Service\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe SeAT web interface requires a web server to serve the HTML goodies it has. We highly encourage you to use nginx\nand will be covered in this document. You don't \nhave\n to use it, so if you prefer something else, feel free.\n\n\nLet's install nginx:\n\n\napt-get install nginx php7.1-fpm\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate the standard www pool configuration file from PHP-Fpm to a dedicated SeAT pool:\n\n\ncp /etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf /etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/seat.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, update the newly created pool file at \n/etc/php/7.1/fpm/pool.d/seat.conf\n with some adequate values :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitial value\n\n\nnew value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[www]\n\n\n[seat]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser = www-data\n\n\nuser = seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngroup = www-data\n\n\ngroup = seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlisten = /run/php/php7.1-fpm.sock\n\n\nlisten = /run/php/seat.sock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done, you can create a new configuration file into nginx to server SeAT called \n/etc/nginx/sites-available/seat\n \n\n\nAnd put the content bellow inside:\n\n\nserver \n{\n\n    listen \n80\n;\n\n    listen \n[\n::\n]\n:80\n;\n\n\n    root /var/www/seat/public\n;\n\n\n    index index.htm index.html index.php\n;\n\n\n    location / \n{\n\n       try_files \n$uri\n \n$uri\n/ /index.php?\n$query_string\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    location ~ \n\\.\nphp$ \n{\n\n       try_files \n$uri\n \n=\n404\n;\n\n       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/seat.sock\n;\n\n       fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME \n$document_root$fastcgi_script_name\n;\n\n       include fastcgi_params\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    location ~ /\n\\.\nht \n{\n\n       deny all\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's symlink to the active config and drop the default one :\n\n\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seat\nrm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, reload services :\n\n\nservice php7.1-fpm reload\nservice nginx reload\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin Login\n\u00b6\n\n\nSince SeAT 3.0, an admin user is a real dedicated user and you will no longer be able to link characters or\ncorporations to it. Using the admin user, you will probably and most typically just add your main character to the\nSuperuser group and never login as an admin again.\n\n\nTo login as an administrator, simply run the following command :\n\n\nsudo -H -u seat bash -c \n'php /var/www/seat/artisan seat:admin:login'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get a link after the command has finished running which looks similar to the one bellow :\n\n\nhttp://yourserver/auth/login/admin/somerandomstring\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy it and paste it inside your browser and you will be authenticated as the admin user.",

It comes without saying\nthat database security is a very important aspect too. So, ensure that you choose very strong passwords for your\ninstallation where required.  This document describes using MariaDB, but you can use MySQL as well. Just double check the requirements.  Let's start by using an editor to create the file  /etc/apt/source.list.d/mariadb.list  ( nano  or  vi  works well for\nsuch things). Inside the newly created file, simply paste the block bellow :   \n   Stretch 9 \n   Jessie 8     deb http://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.2/repo/debian stretch main  Once done, we will add the GPG key from MariaDB repository into our keychain using  apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8    deb http://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb-10.2/repo/debian jessie main  Once done, we will add the GPG key from MariaDB repository into our keychain using  apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xCBCB082A1BB943DB     Lets install the database server:  apt-get install mariadb-server  Next, we are going to secure the database server by removing anonymous access and setting a  root  password.   Note  The database  root  password should not be confused with the operating systems  root  passwords.\nThey are both completely different. They should also not be the same password.   To secure the database, run:  mysql_secure_installation  This will ask you a series of questions, below is how these should be answered:  [ ... ] \n\nEnter current password  for  root  ( enter  for  none ) :  BY DEFAULT IT IS NONE, PRESS ENTER\nOK, successfully used password, moving on... [ ... ] \n\nSet root password?  [ Y/n ]  y\nNew password:             SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nRe-enter new password:    SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE\nPassword updated successfully!\nReloading privilege tables..\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove anonymous users?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nDisallow root login remotely?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ] \n\nRemove  test  database and access to it?  [ Y/n ]  y [ ... ] \n\nReload privilege tables now?  [ Y/n ]  y\n ... Success! [ ... ]   That concludes the installation of the database server and securing it.\nNext, we need to create an actual database for SeAT to use on the server.\nFor that we need to use the MySQL command line client and enter a few commands to create the database and the user\nthat will be accessing it.\nLet get to it.  Fire up the MySQL client by running:  mysql -uroot -p  This will prompt you for a password.\nUse the password you configured for the  root  account when we ran  mysql_secure_installation .\nThis will most probably be the last time you need to use this password :)\nIf the password was correct, you should see a prompt similar to the one below:  [ ... ] \nmysql>  Lets run the command to create the SeAT database:  create database seat ;   The output should be similar to the below:  mysql> create database seat ; \nQuery OK,  1  row affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   Next, we create the user that SeAT itself will use to connect and use the  seat  database:  GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ;   Of course, you need to replace  s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd  with your own.\nSuccessfully running this should present you with output similar to the below:  mysql> GRANT ALL ON seat.* to seat@localhost IDENTIFIED BY  's_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd' ; \nQuery OK,  0  rows affected  ( 0 .00 sec )   In the example above, we have effectively declared that SeAT will be using the database as seat:s_p3rs3c3r3tp455w0rd@localhost/seat .\nFinally, we will reload sql server permission cache  FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;    Note  Remember the password for the  seat  database user as we will need it later to configure SeAT.",

This allows for SeAT administrators to granularly control who has access to what based on which roles a SeAT user has.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis section aims to clear up the definitions used in the SeAT RBAC (Role-based Access Control) implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\nA SeAT user account. This can be either a user account that was created in SeAT itself, or an automatically created account based on SSO. The only difference between the accounts is that with an SSO account, SeAT has no idea what the accounts password is. Otherwise, everything else is exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission\n\nA Permission is an attribute that is assigned to a \nRole\n. It grants access based on the specific permission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\n\nA Role is simply a collection of permissions. Users get assigned a roles and inherit the permissions granted by that role. A user can not be given a raw permission. Permissions can only be granted my creating a Role, assigning permissions to the Role and granting the role to a user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiliation\n\nAffiliations allow administrators to set permissions bound to a specific entity. When configuring a role, permissions are granted to the role. When the an affiliation is set, the role effectively gives the permissions to the specified entities in the affiliation list. Not all roles are affected by affiliations. By default, only Corporation and Character roles are affected by affiliations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntity\n\nAn entity is either a Character or a Corporation identified by its unique ID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\u00b6\n\n\nCorporation accountant\n\u00b6\n\n\nLets assume you wanted to create a role for a corporation accountant. To acheive this, you would do the following:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new role. Name it something like \nCorporation Accountant\n.\n\n\nEdit the new role, and grant it the \nCorporation.ledger\n, \nCorporation.walletJournal\n, \nCorporation.transactions\n and \nCorporation.summary\n (to view the sheet) permissions.\n\n\nNext, affiliate the role with the corporation(s) for whom this role should act as an accountant.\n\n\nOptionally, assign some users to the role. You can assign users at a later stage too.\n\n\n\n\nYour configured role from the above example may now look as follows:\n\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe next list is a short definition of what the currently available permissions are and which sections of SeAT they grant access to. For the latest list of available permissions, please refer to the definitions file in the \neveseat/web\n package \nhere\n.\n\n\nAffiliation\n column shows if the permissions considers affiliations.\n\n\nDangerous\n column shows if the permission could be harmful if granted to the wrong user.\n\n\nGlobal Permissions\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermission\n\n\nAffiliation\n\n\nDangerous\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuperuser\n\n\nNo\n\n\nYes\n\n\nGrants administrative access to SeAT.

This guide applies to any other installation type only.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Upgrades\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs with anything, it is a \nvery\n good idea to have backups ready before attempting any upgrades. In the case of SeAT, the most important component that needs to be backed up is the SeAT database. In short, something as simple as \nmysqldump -uroot -p seat > backup.sql\n should be perfectly fine. Should something go wrong, then you can simply re-install SeAT, restore the database and you should be good to go.\n\n\nUpgrade Options\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are 2 ways to upgrade SeAT.

Follow the next steps to get this done:\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven't downloaded the \nseat\n tool yet, do so now by running \nbash <(curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-installer)\n.\n\n\nIf you already have the \nseat\n tool downloaded, make sure the tool itself is at its latest version. Do this by running: \nseat update:self\n.\n\n\nIf you have not yet backed up your database, do so now!

By default this should be \n/var/www/seat\n.\n\n\nPut your application into maintenance mode. This will ensure that no request from the outside will hit your applications logic, and also help you perform an upgrade uninterrupted. Do this with:\n\n\n\n\nphp artisan down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts a good thing to update \ncomposer\n itself. This is not a hard requirement, but definitely recommended. Do this with:\n\n\n\n\ncomposer self-update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing to do is get the latest SeAT packages. The below example adds the \n--no-dev\n argument as these packages are generally not needed in production. Upgrade the packages with:\n\n\n\n\ncomposer update --no-dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the packages upgraded, we can now publish any new migrations/assets/configs.

The biggest change is a Laravel framework upgrade to version 5.3.

Its therefore recommended that you start by putting SeAT into maintenance mode before starting the upgrade. Do this by running the following command in your SeAT path.\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www/seat\n$ php artisan down\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see the message \nApplication is now in maintenance mode.\n.\n\n\nBackups\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nMake a backup of your SeAT database and store it somewhere safe! \nDo not skip this step!\n\n\nIn your SeAT directory, make a copy of the \n.env\n file.

If you reuse this path then no webserver re-configuration will be needed. We will move the old installation out of the way, and install SeAT 2.0. To do this, run the following commands:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, move the old installation out of the way:\n\n\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www\n$ mv seat seat.old\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can double check that this was successful by running \nls\n and ensuring that there is a folder named \nseat.old\n now.\n\n\n\n\nNext, get the new SeAT code by running \ncomposer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\n:\n\n\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www\n$ composer create-project eveseat/seat seat --no-dev\nInstalling eveseat/seat \n(\n2\n.0.0\n)\n\n  - Installing eveseat/seat \n(\n2\n.0.0\n)\n\n    Loading from cache\n\nCreated project in seat\n> php -r \n\"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\"\n\nLoading composer repositories with package information\nUpdating dependencies\n\n\n[\n ... snip ... \n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublish the assets\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, we need to publish the new SeAT 2.0 CSS & Javascript and database migrations. This can be done with \nphp artisan vendor:publish --force\n.\n\n\nReconfigure \n.env\n file\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the new code ready to use, the next thing that is required is to reconnect the database. Remember that \n.env\n file you backed up earlier? Refer to it for the values needed in the newly installed env file that can be found at \n/var/www/seat/.env\n.\n\n\nImportant keys to populate with the correct values are:\n\n\nDB_HOST\n=\n\n\nDB_PORT\n=\n\n\nDB_DATABASE\n=\n\n\nDB_USERNAME\n=\n\n\nDB_PASSWORD\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeAT 2.0 introduced new configuration items in the \n.env\n that you can review. There is also the option to configure Supervisor & SeAT integration, which can be done by following the admin guide titled \nSeAT & Supervisor Integration\n.\n\n\nRun migrations\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the database reconnected, its time to run the migrations for SeAT 2.0. This is the part that may take some time, depending on how big your database is.\n\n\nTo run the migrations, make sure you are still in your seat path (\n/var/www/seat\n) and run \nphp artisan migrate\n:\n\n\n$ \ncd\n /var/www/seat\n$ php artisan migrate\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a bunch of messages and eventually your shell prompt again, indicating that it has completed. If you receive errors here, double check that you have entered the correct database settings in the \n.env\n file previously mentioned.\n\n\nDatabase seeders\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith the database migration complete, its time to seed it with some of the static data SeAT needs.

You can edit the command used to start a worker in your \nseat.conf\n file in supervisor.

            "text": "Developers Guides - Package Development\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntroduction\n\u00b6\n\n\nSo, you want to write a SeAT package? Hopefully this guide helps you along the way!\n\nThis guide was written while writing the API package for SeAT \nhere\n. I figured it would be best to try and capture the process as I am going through it to help in case I miss any important details.\n\n\nBackground notes\n\u00b6\n\n\nI think its important to keep in mind a few things about how SeAT is put together. The most important being a brief description of what each core package offers, and how you can integrate with them. For a breakdown on what the core packages provide, please refer the to breakdown \nhere\n.\n\n\nSeAT 2.x is written on \nLaravel 5.3 LTS\n. A \nvery\n good thing to do would be to actually read the documentation top->bottom and get an idea of what is possible with the framework. SeAT core packages make heavy use of many of the features, based directly of what has been interpreted by this very documentation.\n\n\nIf you really want to start contributing packages, but juts cant get your head around this whole Laravel thing, then I can suggest you have a look at this excellent free course material covering the basics of what you will encounter in the SeAT codebase. \nhttps://laracasts.com/series/laravel-5-fundamentals\n\n\nBest practices\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to avoid conflicts with SeAT core, here are a few best practices which should help develop packages in isolation and prevent inconvenient conflicts in the future.\n\n\n\n\nPrefix your github repository name with \nseat\n eg: \nseat-teamspeak\n.\n\n\nTag your github repository with \nseat\n.\n\n\nUse a unique package namespace such as \nAuthor\\Seat\\Package\\\n eg: \nWarlof\\Seat\\Teamspeak\\\n.\n\n\nPrefix your database table names with something unique to your package. eg \nwarlof_teamspeak_users\n.\n\n\nDo not modify core tables. This will break future updates for users of you package.\n\n\nPrefix your settings with both an author and package eg: \nwarlof.teamspeak.address\n.\n\n\nPrefix redis records with both author and package eg: \nwarlof.teamspeak.channels\n.\n\n\nIn your \ncomposer.json\n file, set the \ntype\n to \nseat-plugin\n.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe very first thing to do is prepare the empty git repository on say Github, as well as the composer package itself. Clone a clean repo, and run \ncomposer init\n, answering any questions. Once that is done, edit the resultant \ncomposer.json\n and prepare the \nautoload\n block. SeAT core follows the \nPSR-4\n autoloading standard. I will suggest you do the same. For some more detailed composer info, refer to the docs \nhere\n. For the API package, I am going to autoload \nSeat\\Api\n from the \nsrc\n directory using PSR-4.\n\n\nService provider\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs mentioned in the package breakdowns \nhere\n, the \neveseat/seat\n repository bootstraps the packages via service providers. This is actually a Laravel convention that SeAT just follows. To get our package ready, we need to create a service provider. Thankfully there is a command to stub a new one for us. For the API package, I just ran \nphp artisan make:provider ApiServiceProvider\n and copied the resultant file from \napp/Providers\n to my packages \nsrc/\n directory. Our packages file structure now looks as follows:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage structure\n\u00b6\n\n\nFrom here you pretty much free to do what you want. How you structure the package will obviously depend on what exactly your package provides. In principle, I prefer to follow the same package structure as Laravel does for web / console features. Since we are going to be providing web features with the API, we will quickly create a few folders in preparation for this. I know beforehand that we are going to need a model to store API tokens; middleware to authenticate API requests; routes and controllers for the actual api logic (preferably making use of the \neveapi/services\n repository classes for data access) as well as a few web views for administrators to generate API tokens for applications. With that in mind, the initial structure looks as follows:\n\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 composer.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ApiServiceProvider.php\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Config\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Http\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Controllers\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Middleware\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Models\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 database\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 migrations\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 resources\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 views\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will obviously change as we progress making the package.\n\n\nRoutes and controllers\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo start testing the API, we need to add a route and controller to process some requests and responses. My routes.php will have a global \nRoute::group()\n to encapsulate the routes in the \nSeat\\Api\n namespace as well as prefix them with \napi/\n.\n\n\n// File: routes.php\n\n\nRoute::group([\n\n\n    'namespace' => 'Seat\\Api\\Http\\Controllers',\n\n\n    'prefix' => 'api'\n\n\n], function () {\n\n\n\n    // Logic here\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the final product \nhere\n for a more complete example.\n\n\nNext, I add some logic with a route to \n/\n, update the base frameworks \ncomposer.json\n to autoload the \nSeat\\Api\n namespace from the directory where my package lives, run \ncomposer dump-autoload\n and add the service provider to the \neveseat/seat\n repositories \napp.php\n providers array. Lastly, I add a method to the service provider to load the routes and call it form the \nboot()\n method in the generated stub.\n\n\nSee the complete service provider \nhere\n\n\n/**\n\n\n* Include the routes\n\n\n*/\n\n\npublic function add_routes()\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n    if (!$this->app->routesAreCached()) {\n\n\n        include __DIR__ . '/Http/routes.php';\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a final test, I check that my route is accessible from a booted SeAT app. :)  \n\n\nRoutes - access control\n\u00b6\n\n\nObviously, some routes are not for everyones eyes. SeAT comes with middleware that can be used to filter out requests that may not be authorized for your route. As can be seen in the example below (from \nhere\n), we are filtering out requests to \napi-admin\n for only superusers.\n\n\nRoute::group([\n\n\n        'namespace'  => 'Admin',\n\n\n        'middleware' => 'bouncer:superuser', // The ACL specification.\n\n\n        'prefix'     => 'api-admin'\n\n\n    ], function () {\n\n\n        Route::get('/', [\n\n\n            'as'   => 'api-admin.list',\n\n\n            'uses' => 'ApiAdminController@listTokens']);\n\n\n    });\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest you have a look at the \neveseat/web\n packages routes definitions for more examples on how the middlewares are used. \nhttps://github.com/eveseat/web/tree/master/src/Http/Routes\n\n\nMiddleware\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo auth our API requests, we are going to go with token based authentication for now. We want users to present us with a \nX-Token\n header (from a valid allowed src IP address) before they may proceed with their request. To do this, we will filter requests using middleware. Thankfully, again, Laravel comes with a command to stub us some empty middleware. Run \nphp artisan make:middleware ApiToken\n and copy it to your projects \nMiddleware\n folder. Next we should register the middleware in our service provider. I do this by adding a method and calling it in \nboot()\n.\n\n\nSee the complete middleware \nhere\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * Include the middleware needed\n\n\n *\n\n\n * @param $router\n\n\n */\n\n\npublic function add_middleware($router)\n\n\n{\n\n\n\n    // Authenticate checks that the token is valid\n\n\n    // from an allowed IP address\n\n\n    $router->middleware('api.auth', ApiToken::class);\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlthough almost all of our interfacing with this package will be via the json api endpoints, we need to add a few routes that will give an administrator the ability to generate API tokens, as well as view logs etc. As mentioned, this will be for an administrator, so we will re-use the ACL features provided by the \neveseat/web\n package to ensure that only admins an access our api-admin routes.\n\nViews live in \nresources/views\n and are bootstrapped to the \napi\n namespace in the service provider. See the service provider \nhere\n for an example.\n\n\nNote how we are re-using views that exist in the \nweb\n namespace. All we have to do is extend one of the \ngrids\n like \nhere\n and start without our blade template.\n\n\nViews - sidebar menu\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the sidebar is also really easy. All you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The config file itself has a set structure for the \nweb\n package to interpret and can be seen \nhere\n.\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    'api' => [\n\n\n        'permission'    => 'Superuser',\n\n\n        'name'          => 'Api Tokens',\n\n\n        'icon'          => 'fa-exchange',\n\n\n        'route_segment' => 'api-admin',\n\n\n        'entries'       => [\n\n\n            [   // Manage API Tokens\n\n\n                'name'  => 'Manage',\n\n\n                'icon'  => 'fa-key',\n\n\n                'route' => 'api-admin.list'\n\n\n            ]\n\n\n        ]\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe format is generally an array, whereby the first key is the name of your package (\napi\n in this case). Thereafter you can specify the main entry, and any sub entries you want to add. The \nroute\n key should refer to the named route. The sidebar loader will resolve the route itself for you. If you have any permissions requirements for your package, the \npermission\n key can be used together with a required SeAT permission to render the view.\n\n\nViews - character submenus\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the character sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named \npackage.character.menu\n in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below:\n\n\n// file: package.character.menu.php\n\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    [\n\n\n        'name'           => 'Research',\n\n\n        'permission'     => 'character.research',\n\n\n        'highlight_view' => 'research',\n\n\n        'route'          => 'character.view.research'\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews - corporation submenus\n\u00b6\n\n\nIntegrating with the corporation sub menus is also really easy. Just like the sidebar and character menus, all you have to do is create a config file, bootstrap it in the service provider and viola. The namespace should be named \npackage.corporation.menu\n in your service provider. A sample config file can be seen below:\n\n\n// file: package.corporation.menu.php\n\n\n\nreturn [\n\n\n    [\n\n\n        'name'           => 'Research',\n\n\n        'permission'     => 'corporation.research',\n\n\n        'highlight_view' => 'research',\n\n\n        'route'          => 'corporation.view.research'\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews - bootstrapping menu items\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn the above items, we refer to the files needing to be \nbootstrapped\n via the service provider. All this really means is that we have to tell the Laravel application where to find configuration information for a namespace. So, if we wanted to add a sidebar item, we would add the following line to the \nregister()\n method of the service provider:\n\n\n// Include this packages menu items\n\n\n$this->mergeConfigFrom(__DIR__ . '/Config/package.sidebar.php', 'package.sidebar');\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument is the file with the sidebar definitions, the second is the namespace.\n\n\nDatabase\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor our API package, we have a database requirement. We need to store api tokens and the ip address that is allowed to use them. We are also going to store an access log (based on the config setting). We create migrations and models just like you would for a base Laravel 5.1 application. The only thing to remember is that your migrations for your package must be published (and specified in your service provider).",
